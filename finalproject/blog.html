<h2 id="scf1" class="">Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron redefines meaning of playoff warrior in Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p> <a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_center_patrice_bergeron_redefines_meaning_of_playoff_warrior_in_stanley_cup_final.html" target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-23T17:11-05:00"pubdate>June 23, 2013, 5:11 PM EST</a></time></p>


<p>Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron really wanted to win the Stanley Cup.</p>

<p>No, he really, really wanted it.</p>

<p>The assistant captain went to great lengths, doing whatever possible to be out on the ice with his teammates.</p>

<p>You might as well rephrase the term <q>playoff warrior</q> to <q>Patrice Bergeron.</q></p>

<p>After the Bruins were shocked by Chicago in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final Monday night at TD Garden, as the Blackhawks captured the best-of-7 series, Bergeron made himself available in the locker room and revealed his ailments.</p>

<p>He said he played with a broken rib, torn cartilage and a separated shoulder.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t known when these injuries were exactly sustained.</p>

<p>During the team&rsquo;s breakup day at the Garden Wednesday, general manager Peter Chiarelli shed more light on Bergeron&apos;s health during a press conference.</p>

<p>Chiarelli said to deal with the torn cartilage, Bergeron opted to have a freezing procedure done to block a nerve in order to play Game 6.</p>

<p>Postgame Bergeron suffered a small puncture in his lung from either the nerve blockage or the cracked rib.</p>

<p>If the puncture happened during the game, Bergeron would not have been able to play.</p>

<p>He went straight to the hospital for observation after meeting with the media and is still currently being treated.</p>

<p>With that all said Chiarelli insists Bergeron is fine.</p>

<p>His shoulder separated during the first period, but he did not miss a shift and finished with 17:45 of ice time &mdash; his lowest total of the series.</p>

<p>That is just crazy.</p>

<p>Last postseason, Bergeron played with a torn oblique muscle. He suffered it in Game 3 of the first round against the Washington Capitals. He aggravated it in Game 5 and on top of that got his nose broken by an accidental elbow by Alexander Semin.</p>

<p>The pain was obvious.</p>

<p>Bergeron took only one draw in Game 7, which he won, and wasn&apos;t able to stretch far enough to potentially score the game-winning goal in overtime before Joel Ward did as the Capitals knocked off the defending Stanley Cup champions.</p>

<p>Learning the specifics of what Bergeron was ailing from this postseason is mind boggling.</p>

<p>This guy refused to sit out.</p>

<p>He could have been hit by a bus and still be in the lineup the next game.</p>

<p>Never in a million years would you hear this kind of story about a Major League Baseball player, which has been the running joke.</p>

<p>The Bruins are lucky to have Bergeron. Hopefully he is going to be OK.</p>

<p><strong>FAREWELL FERENCE:</strong> Chiarelli also revealed at his press conference that he told defenseman Andrew Ference that the club will not be resigning him.</p>

<p><q>It was a tough conversation to have,</q> Chiarelli said.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent on July 1 with his three-year, $6.75 million contract expiring.</p>

<p>With the salary cap dropping from $70.2 million to $64.3 million next season, the Bruins simply can&apos;t afford to keep everyone. And with the emergence of rookie defensemen Torey Krug and Matt Bartkowski during the playoffs, it makes the decision to let Ference go a little easier.</p>

<p>Ference means a lot to the organization. His locker room presence and leadership will be missed.</p>

<p>His <q>Player of the Game</q> tradition, which started during the 2011 playoffs with the vintage Bruins Starter jacket, shows his true character.</p>

<p>He carried on the tradition with <q>The Chain</q> in 2012.</p>

<p>But mostly notably, his mark will be left with the Army ranger jacket who his friend, active army ranger at the time Lucas Carr gave to him after a visit to the Fort Benning base in Georgia.</p>

<h2 id="scf2" class="">Lack of production from top players doomed Boston Bruins in Stanley Cup Final</h2>

<p> <a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/lack_of_production_from_top_players_doomed_boston_bruins_in_stanley_cup_final.html" target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-25T16:02-05:00"pubdate>June 25, 4:02 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Boston Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk called it <q>one of the worst feelings.</q></p>

<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference said it was <q>disappointing.</q></p>

<p>What looked to be an evenly matched best-of-7 Stanley Cup Final turned into a dominant performance by the Chicago Blackhawks over the last three games to close the series in six.</p>

<p>The Blackhawks outplayed and outwitted the Black and Gold to hoist the chalice on TD Garden ice after a crazy ending Monday night, which saw Boston&apos;s one-goal lead disappear in a matter of 17 seconds as the Blackhawks took a 3-2 victory in Game 6.</p>

<p>How did it happen?</p>

<p>Chicago showed the hockey world why it was the better team and deserved to win the championship for the second time in four years.</p>

<p>It shut down the Bruins&apos; biggest offensive threats and messed with their style of play.</p>

<p>Brad Marchand posted zeros and was a minus-3. He was a key player in the 2011 Stanley Cup title run, but he failed to show up this time around.</p>

<p>David Krejci, who had been shaping up as a candidate for the Conn Smythe Trophy, suddenly couldn&apos;t find the back of the net after lighting it up all postseason.</p>

<p>Nathan Horton wasn&apos;t the same player after being bothered by a separated shoulder that caused him to leave during the first extra period of the 4-3 triple-overtime bummer in Game 1.</p>

<p>Horton entered with a plus-21 rating to lead all players in the postseason, but was a minus-3 in the final.</p>

<p>Tyler Seguin never reached the level of expectation surrounding him and finished the playoffs with just one goal, which came all the way back in the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Blackhawks&apos; biggest stars stepped up when needed most.</p>

<p>Conn Smythe winner Patrick Kane potted three goals and easily could have had more.</p>

<p>After struggling to score all postseason, captain Jonathan Toews delivered key strikes in Games 4 and 6.</p>

<p>Bryan Bickell, who was compared to Bruins winger Milan Lucic at the start of the series, finished strong with a three-game points streak and scored the tying goal with 1:16 remaining Monday.</p>

<p>Toews assisted on the play.</p>

<p><q>I think the team on the other side is a hell of a team that earned it,</q> Ference said. <q>But I think by the same token they&apos;ll say we gave them as hard a push as anybody could have to win the Cup. If you win it, you earn it, that&apos;s for sure. I think they earned it. We threw everything we could at them and they absorbed a ton of hits and a lot of adversity and they came through.</q></p>

<p>When you play deep into the playoffs, injuries are bound to happen.</p>

<p>Bruins center Patrice Bergeron revealed after Game 6 that he was fighting through a broken rib, torn cartilage and a separated shoulder.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien said defenseman Zdeno Chara wasn&apos;t 100 percent, though no player likely was. Chara wouldn&apos;t talk about his physical condition.</p>

<p>He was on the ice for 11 of Chicago&rsquo;s 17 goals in the series. It doesn&apos;t mean they were his fault, however it&apos;s uncharacteristic for the captain who anchors the Bruins&apos; back end.</p>

<p>Though these can be used as excuses, the Bruins certainly aren&apos;t.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;d say 90 percent of us were banged up with something,</q> Seguin said. <q>... We wear so much pride on our jersey and we fight for each other. This city deserved for us to do that and for us to give it our all. No regrets ... we need to take this rest, obviously get our conditioning back up and get ready for training camp.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf3" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Patrice Bergeron played with broken rib in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_patrice_bergeron_played_with_broken_rib_in_game_6_of_the_stanley_cup_final.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-25T03:56-05:00"pubdate>June 25, 2013, 3:56 AM EST</a></time></p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; Bruins center Patrice Bergeron revealed to reporters that he played with multiple injuries, including a broken rib in Boston&apos;s 3-2 Game 6 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Final Monday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Bergeron also suffered from torn cartilage and a separated shoulder.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear when exactly these injuries occurred.</p>

<p>Bergeron was bothered by something during the second period of Game 5 Saturday, which was later termed as a <q>body injury.</q></p>

<p>He tried to skate through it, but couldn&apos;t after taking two brief shifts in the third period before leaving for good and being transported to a local area hospital in Chicago.</p>

<p>The Bruins weren&apos;t sure whether or not their two-way center would be a go for Game 6, but coach Claude Julien was optimistic and right on with the assumption.</p>

<p><q>To have him in our lineup tonight was a bonus,</q> Julien said. <q>And again, there was nothing that was going to stop this guy from getting in our lineup. That&apos;s why I can&apos;t speak enough about how proud I am of our players...he wasn&apos;t going to be denied that opportunity no matter what.</q></p>

<p>Bergeron didn&apos;t miss a shift. He finished with 17:45 of ice time and won 45 percent of his draws (5 of 11).</p>

<h2 id="scf4" class="">Chicago Blackhawks score 2 goals in final 76 seconds to shock Boston Bruins, hoist Stanley Cup</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/chicago_blackhawks_score_2_goals_in_76_seconds_to_shock_boston_bruins_hoist_stanley_cup.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-24T23:12-05:00"pubdate>June 24, 2013, 11:23 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins were 76 seconds away from forcing a decisive Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final.</p>

<p>But in a flash it was gone.</p>

<p>With Chicago Blackhawks netminder Corey Crawford pulled for the extra attacker, winger Bryan Bickell tied it.</p>

<p>Then 17 seconds later, Dave Bolland gave Chicago the lead with 59 seconds left.</p>

<p>It was all the Blackhawks needed to hoist Lord Stanley&apos;s Cup on TD Garden ice as they defeated the Bruins, 3-2 in Game 6 Monday night before 17,565 shocked fans to take the best-of-7 series four games to two.</p>

<p>Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for the most valuable player.</p>

<p>It&apos;s Chicago&apos;s second Stanley Cup championship in four years as it won in 2010, also in six games, over the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s a bad feeling, awful feeling,</q> Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>You can&apos;t really describe it. As a player it&apos;s probably one of the worst feelings you can get when you&apos;re up by one goal with 1:20 or whatever left and somehow you lose the game. It&apos;s a total shock.</q></p>

<p>It looked like a lock that there would be a Game 7 Wednesday night back at the United Center in Chicago.</p>

<p>Winger Milan Lucic broke a 1-1 tie at 12:11 of the third period with his fourth goal of the series.</p>

<p>In a battle behind the Chicago net, David Krejci gained control of the puck and found Lucic hanging in the low slot.</p>

<p>But the Bruins couldn&apos;t execute their shutdown defense, which carried them up until Game 4, where they were clearly rattled after allowing six goals.</p>

<p>In hindsight, Game 4 was the turning point of the series. Boston couldn&apos;t scrape out a win after that.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s shocking,</q> said Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask, who finished with 28 saves. <q>You think you have things under control. We killed a big penalty there. We were thinking &lsquo;oh, we&apos;re just going to keep it tight and score maybe an empty-netter.&rsquo; And then, all of a sudden, they score a goal.</q></p>

<p>It was a weird game for the Bruins.</p>

<p>They came out hungry and were dominant in the first period. However, they held only a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>In the second period, the momentum the Bruins were riding dissolved and all of those missed opportunities came back to haunt them.</p>

<p>They had four power-play opportunities, two apiece in the first and second period, but couldn&apos;t jam the puck past Crawford.</p>

<p><q>It was a battle. Everybody left it all out there,</q> Rask said. <q>We had some guys playing through injuries, lost (Gregory Campbell) there, but that&apos;s how playoffs go. You have to battle through those. This year, we weren&apos;t fortunate enough to stay healthy and have a full squad. But still it&apos;s no excuse.</q></p>

<p>Though not publicly announced, the Bruins&apos; second line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Jaromir Jagr looked bothered by injuries.</p>

<p>Marchand wasn&apos;t the same player from the Eastern Conference finals series against Pittsburgh where he got under everyone&apos;s skin and backed it up with his stick.</p>

<p>He finished the series with zeros across the board and at minus-3.</p>

<p>Bergeron, who was questionable after suffering an undisclosed body injury in Game 5, played, but wasn&apos;t his effective self.</p>

<p>Jagr was ailed by something during the first period. He was seen on the bench, face down, holding his nose and didn&apos;t return until the second period.</p>

<p>He skated only two shifts before departing down the tunnel.</p>

<p>Carl Soderberg played in his spot on the first power-play unit, while Marchand, Bergeron and Tyler Seguin were reunited on the second line for the time being.</p>

<p>The lines were switched back to normal in the third.</p>

<p>Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews tied it 1-1 at 4:24.</p>

<p>Toews won a board battle with Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara after a faceoff in the neutral zone and snapped a shot from the right faceoff circle through Rask&apos;s 5-hole.</p>

<p><q>It was kind of a 50-50 puck,</q> Chara said. <q>We played aggressive, so I went for the puck and it made it by.</q></p>

<p>The third line of Daniel Paille, Chris Kelly and Seguin started out strong in the opening 20 minutes to give the Bruins an early 1-0 lead at 7:19.</p>

<p>After a faceoff attempt in Chicago&apos;s zone, Kelly beat Crawford glove side after a backhanded feed by Seguin.</p>

<p>Blackhawks winger Michael Frolik nearly tied it seconds later while the teams switched off for a line change when the puck was cleared inside the neutral zone.</p>

<p>Frolik was fed alone up front, but Rask stoned him.</p>

<p>There was a scary moment for Blackhawks winger Andrew Shaw. who took a Shawn Thornton shot off his face with 4:01 left in the period.</p>

<p>Shaw was down for several seconds with blood dripping from the right side of his head.</p>

<p>He was escorted off the ice, but returned for the second period.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Jeff Bauman, Carlos Arredondo, Boston fire fighters Jim Plourde and Alector Tavares, Massachusetts state police captain Jeanne Stewart, Massachusetts state police officer Kevin O&apos;Neil, Boston police officers Sean Rooney and Dave Hansford, Watertown police officer Joseph Reynolds and sergeant John MacClellan all served as honorary banner captains ... Jordan Caron collided with Milan Lucic during pregame warmups. Lucic and Zdeno Chara collided in warmups prior to Game 3. Lucic wasn&apos;t wearing a helmet, but appeared to be fine.</p>

	<h2 id="scf5" class="">Boston Bruins need top line of Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton to step up for Game 6 of Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_need_top_line_of_milan_lucic_david_krejci_and_nathan_horton_to_step_up_for_game_6_of_s.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-24T16:17-05:00"pubdate>June 24, 2013, 4:17 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins&apos; top line of Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton has proven to be the team&apos;s most consistent line this postseason.</p>

<p>But through five games in the Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks, their production has slightly declined &mdash; mainly on the scoring front.</p>

<p>Lucic is the only one of his linemates who has found the back of the net heading into a do or die Game 6 Monday at TD Garden with the Blackhawks holding a 3-2 series lead in the best-of-7 set.</p>

<p>He knows how critical his line has been towards the team&apos;s success throughout the playoffs and why they&apos;re contending in their second Cup Final in three years.</p>

<p><q>I think we had a great third period (in Game 5),</q> Lucic said. <q>Maybe the best in the whole final. We&apos;re going to try and build on that.</q></p>

<p>The trio has combined for 11 points. Only three of them are goals all scored by Lucic, who had two in Game 1, which Boston fell 4-3 in overtime.</p>

<p>Krejci still leads the playoffs with 25 points through 21 games.</p>

<p>Though those numbers don&apos;t sound horrific, they all know they can play better.</p>

<p><q>Everyone has to pull their weight and play at their best,</q> Lucic said. <q>These are the games that you want to be a part of and be a big part of.</q></p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien was happy to hear Lucic&apos;s comments.</p>

<p><q>I like the fact that they&apos;re thinking that way,</q> Julien said. <q>That&apos;s what you want your players to say. You want them to be more demanding, you want them to tell you that they want to be better, they need to be better and those two guys answered that question. I&apos;m sure if you asked everyone on our team, they would have said the same thing.</q></p>

<p>Another guy who&apos;s had a quiet series so far is Brad Marchand.</p>

<p>Marchand has no points after tallying four in the Bruins&apos; four-game sweep over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>

<p>Overall he has 13 in 21 games.</p>

<p><strong>ICE NOT SO NICE:</strong> With temperatures reaching above the 90 mark Monday, ice conditions weren&apos;t ideal.</p>

<p>Normally teams wouldn&apos;t be playing this far into June, but because of the NHL lockout, which forced a 48-game condensed schedule, the playoffs started two weeks late.</p>

<p><q>It was OK this morning,</q> Bruins defenseman Torey Krug said. <q>I thought it was obviously better early on (in the series). The more it gets chewed up, it kind of deteriorates, but for us we&apos;re not worried about it. Both teams have to play on the ice so it&apos;s something you can&apos;t focus on. You got to make sure you take care of the puck.</q></p>

<p>Lucic called the ice surface bumpy, but Julien wasn&apos;t too concerned.</p>

<p><q>I thought the ice this morning was in pretty good shape. They&apos;ve done a good job,</q> he said. <q>Walking in here (Sunday) 90 plus degrees it was nice and cool in the arena. Those are conditions you have to play with at this time of year. Everybody&apos;s been through it.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf6" class="">Boston Bruins, no &lsquo;superstars&rsquo; team mentality is what sets them apart in Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_no_superstars_team_mentality_is_what_sets_them_apart_in_stanley_cup_final.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-24T15:10-05:00"pubdate>June 24, 2013, 3:10 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; It&apos;s no secret how tight knit this Boston Bruins team is.</p>

<p>From David Krejci, to Tuukka Rask, Jaromir Jagr and Shawn Thornton, all of them look at each other as equals.</p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t matter how many points you score, how much money you make or how much ice time you log. They have each other&apos;s backs, on and off the ice.</p>

<p><q>The thing I like about our team is it doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re on the road, it&apos;s not always the same guys that are together,</q> coach Claude Julien said. <q>On some night&apos;s you&apos;ll see a certain group together and then it&apos;s a different group of guys (the next) so they mix and match very well. It&apos;s not always the same two, three guys having supper together.</q></p>

<p>It&apos;s that kind of character that makes the Bruins a dangerous club to deal and a reason why they&apos;re playing for a chance for the Stanley Cup for the second time in three years.</p>

<p><q>We have a resilient group in here,</q> Bruins center Chris Kelly said. <q>We&apos;re a team that wants to play for each other and wants to play well.</q></p>

<p>No doubt, there are a lot of different personalities and views.</p>

<p>Krejci is the quiet one. Brad Marchand is the jokester. Kelly is the so-called loud mouth that the media never sees.</p>

<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference has very strong beliefs to preserve a healthy and clean environment.</p>

<p>This season he teamed up with Bruins blog Stanley Cup of Chowder and PlantaBillion.org and pledged that he&apos;d plant 50 trees for every goal teammate Tyler Seguin scored this season.</p>

<p>Stanley Cup of Chowder said it would plant 50 for every goal Ference scored.</p>

<p>But not everyone on the team has a <q>Go Green</q> mentality and it doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is how everyone is treated, not whether or not they share the same views.</p>

<p>The way Julien talked about how the young and older players hang out together was like how a father talks about his sons. He was very touched and proud of the way he spoke about his player&apos;s actions.</p>

<p>In reality, some players are old-young enough to be father-son age.</p>

<p>Defenseman Dougie Hamilton at 20-years-old, is one of the youngest players on the team while Jagr, 41, is the eldest.</p>

<p>Jagr, a future Hall of Fame candidate who could put himself above the team, doesn&apos;t. No one does.</p>

<p><q>It goes back to what I said earlier, about our hockey team. We don&apos;t see anybody as superstars in that dressing room,</q> Julien said. <q>If people on the outside want to call them superstar players that&apos;s fine, but in our dressing room we all believe we&apos;re on the same level and we treat each other with respect. I think that&apos;s one of the reasons we&apos;re (in the Stanley Cup Final), because we play for each other and we respect each other. That&apos;s a big key to success of a hockey club.</q></p>

<p><q>I think it&apos;s important to have that relationship off the ice, which we all do,</q> Kelly said. <q>We all get along, there&apos;s no cliques. Everyone hangs out with everyone, it&apos;s a real family atmosphere in here.</q></p>

<p>Kelly was traded to Boston from Ottawa in 2011 before the deadline in exchange for a second round pick of that summer&apos;s draft.</p>

<p>Like most of his teammates, he was a part of that magical Cup run and later signed to an extension after the 2012 season because general manager Peter Chiarelli felt he was part of the strong championship core.</p>

<p>This season could be the end for this group as a handful of guys have contracts that will expire on July 1.</p>

<p>They include forwards Nathan Horton (unrestricted free agent), Kaspars Daugavins (restricted free agent), Jay Pandolfo (UFA) and Jagr (UFA), defensemen Wade Redden (UFA) and Aaron Johnson (UFA) and Ference (UFA) and goalies Anton Khudobin (UFA) and Rask (RFA).</p>

<p>With a new salary cap limit taking effect next season, Chiarelli simply won&apos;t be able to afford to keep everyone.</p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; With the Stanley Cup on the line, the Boston Bruins may or may not have one of their best players on the ice for a do or die Game 6 against the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>Center Patrice Bergeron was not on the ice for morning skate Monday at TD Garden. Carl Soderberg skated in his spot on the second line with Brad Marchand and Jaromir Jagr.</p>

<p>Jay Pandolfo and Jordan Caron alternated at left wing on the fourth line with Rich Peverley and Shawn Thornton.</p>

<p>However Bruins coach Claude Julien sounded optimistic.</p>

<p><q>Patrice will dress for warmup tonight and I&apos;m feeling confident that he&apos;ll play,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said.</p>

<p>Forwards Jordan Caron and Jay Pandolfo will also be on the ice for warmups in case Bergeron can&apos;t go.</p>

<p>Bergeron suffered an undisclosed body injury during the second period of Game 5 Saturday night in Chicago.</p>

<p>He tried to play through whatever was ailing him in the third period, but quickly got off the ice only after two brief shifts. Bergeron was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.</p>

<p>He was released Sunday morning and flew back with the team to Boston.</p>

<p>Julien didn&apos;t give any indication what Bergeron is suffering from.</p>

<p>Bergeron has been very valuable to his team throughout the playoffs and would be a big loss if he can&apos;t play.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s obviously a big part of our team,</q> Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg said. <q>He&apos;s our best player in all zones ... he means a whole lot to this team.</q></p>

	<h2 id="scf8" class="">Chicago Blackhawks&apos; Jonathan Toews exposes Zdeno Chara, Boston Bruins defense, in Game 4 of Stanley Cup Final</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/chicago_blackhawks_jonathan_toews_exposes_zdeno_chara_boston_bruins_defense_in_game_4_of_stanley_cup.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-20T16:25-05:00" pubdate>June 20, 2013, 4:25 EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Chicago Blackhawks were able to do what no other team has managed to do against the Boston Bruins through the Stanley Cup playoffs &mdash; knock them off their game.</p>

<p>And it was a complete success.

<p>The Blackhawks dismantled the Bruins&apos; defensive corps and struck in six goals by netminder Tuukka Rask to tie the best-of-7 Stanley Cup Final series at two games apiece turning it into a best-of-3 after winning Game 4 Wednesday night 6-5 in overtime at TD Garden.</p>

<p><q>They got a lot of shots through and a lot of second opportunities,</q> Rask said. <q>You know, you let six goals as a goalie, you can&apos;t be satisfied, but as a team I thought it wasn&apos;t our best defensive game.</q></p>

<p>You got that right.</p>

<p>The Bruins were completely careless. Every time you looked, the Blackhawks were one step ahead of them whether it was puck battles, rushes, on the forecheck, you name it.</p>

<p>Shooting lanes were left wide open. Rask was screened in front. It was a mess.</p>

<p>It was tough to stomach especially after a superb Game 3 performance where the defense was perfect.</p>

<p>Almost no one was caught out of position and when an error occurred, it was cleaned up.</p>

<p>The top defensive unit of Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg made life miserable for the Blackhawks, pushing them around, poke-checking the puck away.</p>

<p>But Wednesday the team pulled a 180 degree turn. They were never able to settle down, regroup, and go back to playing their basic game.</p>

<p>Back and forth high scoring affairs isn&apos;t the team&apos;s culture and usually it&apos;s a bad sign.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien admitted he felt the team never had control at any point.</p>

<p>Rask concurred.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s always hard. Every game is different. Sometimes you feel more comfortable than the other night and (Wednesday) they had a lot of &mdash; we had a lot of breakdowns and they got 2 on 1s, breakaway, stuff like that,</q> Rask said. <q>It&apos;s just a battle out there.</q></p>

<p>Chicago came to play and they came with a plan on how to expose Boston&apos;s best defenseman, Chara.</p>

<p>And Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews wasn&apos;t afraid to say it.</p>

<p><q>For the most part there&apos;s just those little battles, whether it&apos;s with Chara or their other defensemen,</q> Toews said. <q>All our forwards were really keen on winning them. We made a point of it in our locker room. We scored a couple goals off of that.</q></p>

<p>Toews, who&apos;s had a dismal postseason scoring wise, played one of his strongest games.</p>

<p>He won a net front battle with Chara on Brent Seabrook&apos;s winning strike and tipped in Michal Rozsival&apos;s blast from the right point, which gave Chicago a 2-1 lead at 6:33 of the second period.</p>

<p>It was just his second goal of the playoffs.</p>

<p><q>I think it makes a world of difference for you when you finally see one go in,</q> Toews said. <q>I&apos;ve got to say this. The last couple days Seabrook has been coming up to me, asking me what I&apos;m thinking about. I have to give him the right answer. I&apos;m thinking about scoring a goal.</q></p>

<p>One trait we know about the Bruins is that they are able to put games behind them.</p>

<p>They&apos;ll study video. Work on the little things like moving their feet, better decision-making, not taking bad penalties and faceoffs.</p>

<p>The Bruins overwhelmingly dominated the dot in Game 3 winning 71 percent to Chicago&apos;s 29 percent. Game 4 was more evenly matched, with Boston only 2 percent better at 51 to 49.</p>

<p>Game 5 is pivotal for both teams. It&apos;ll mean a must-win Game 6 for either the Bruins or Blackhawks Monday night back at TD Garden.</p>

<h2 id="scf9" class="">Boston Bruins waste Patrice Bergeron&apos;s 2-goal performance; drop Game 4 of Stanley Cup Final 6-5 in overtime</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_waste_patrice_bergerons_2-goal_performance_drop_game_4_of_stanley_cup_final_6-5_in_ove.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-19T23:44-05:00" pubdate>June 19, 2013, 11:44 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; After a strong defensive performance by the Boston Bruins in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final Monday, it was the exact opposite for Game 4.</p>

<p>The Bruins came out completely flat and committed mental mistakes by the ton.</p>

<p>And it cost them big time.</p>

<p>Defenseman Brent Seabrook scored at 9:51 of overtime as the Bruins fell, 6-5 to the Chicago Blackhawks Wednesday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>The best-of-7 series heads back to Chicago for Game 5 Saturday night at the United Center, tied at two games apiece.</p>

<p><q>Chicago came out hard and played extremely well,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>Somehow they had the better of us for the first half of the game until we got ourselves going a little bit.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins never held the lead, but tied the game three times.</p>

<p>They simply weren&apos;t playing their style of game; getting pucks deep, keeping it simple, and throwing their bodies around with brutal hits. And most importantly, playing defense.</p>

<p>Center Patrice Bergeron&apos;s two-goal effort was spoiled.</p>

<p>He scored consecutive times at the end of the second and start of the third periods to tie the game at 4 after the Blackhawks build two-goal leads.</p>

<p>Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk sent the game into the extra period after answering Patrick Sharp&apos;s power-play goal at 12:14 of the third period.</p>

<p>Julien said he never felt his team had full control at any part of the game.</p>

<p><q>I thought our guys battled hard to get us back in the game and create an overtime there, but I don&apos;t think we played our best game (Wednesday),</q> Julien said. <q>There&apos;s a lot of different reasons. Our decision making wasn&apos;t very good at times. I didn&apos;t think we were moving the puck as well as we have been in the pas,, so it was certainly a tough outing for us.</q></p>

<p>Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask finished with 41 saves.</p>

<p>Many times he was left to fend for himself with the Bruins defensemen not doing their jobs and caught out of position.</p>

<p>Corey Crawford made 28 saves for the Blackhawks.</p>

<p>The game got out to a terrible start for Boston, as memories of Game 2&apos;s dismal first- period performance resurfaced in the opening six minutes.</p>

<p>On a power play chance, Bruins right wing Tyler Seguin lost a puck battle next to the Chicago bench and Brandon Saad scooped it up and drove down for a 2 on 1 break with Michal Handzus.</p>

<p>Zdeno Chara wasn&apos;t able to poke-check the puck away and Handzus buried Saad&apos;s tape-to-tape feed past Rask at 6:48 to give the Blackhawks the early 1-0 lead.</p>

<p>Not known for putting up points in the playoffs this year, Bruins wing Rich Peverley tied it at 1 on a power-play strike at 14:43.</p>

<p>It was all Chicago in the second period until the closing minutes when Milan Lucic and Bergeron scored.</p>

<p>Blackhawks forwards Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, and Marcus Kruger all found the back of the net.</p>

<p>Toews tipped in Michal Rozsival&apos;s bomb from the right point as he camped out in front of Rask at 6:33 to give the Blackhawks a 2-1 lead.</p>

<p>After Rask made a huge pad save on Patrick harp, it became obsolete when the Bruins defensive corps couldn&apos;t clear the puck in front.</p>

<p>Kane easily scored on a wide open net to give Chicago a 3-1 lead at 8:41.</p>

<p>This prompted Bruins coach Claude Julien to call his timeout to regroup.</p>

<p><q>We had to get ourselves back into our game,</q> Julien said. <q>I thought we were frustrated and instead of focusing on what we had to do, we were complaining about calls, non-calls, and everything else. We got ourselves away from our game.</q></p>

<p>Lucic put Boston back within one at 14:43 after strong work at the end boards to keep possession. He found Chara at the left point and he found Lucic who skated to the low slot.</p>

<p>But Kruger quickly answered 49 seconds later to give the Blackhawks another two-goal lead.</p>

<p>Bergeron made it interesting as he capitalized on the power play with a quick wrister to put the Bruins back within a goal at the conclusion of the period.</p>

<p>Chara&apos;s initial shot hit off the back glass and bounced in front of the net where Bergeron stood.</p>

<p>At 2:05 of the third period, Jaromir Jagr found Bergeron for the tying strike to make it a new game.</p>

<p><q>Patrice has been extremely good for us throughout these playoffs. He&apos;s been good for us forever,</q> Julien said. <q>He&apos;s a guy who comes and plays hard every time and it&apos;s nice to see him having the good success in the playoffs and be rewarded that way.</q></p>

<p>Not counting his goal, Lucic had a terrible night.</p>

<p>He committed an awful turnover in his own zone and linemate David Krejci was forced to take a hooking penalty on Kane, which gave the Blackhawks a two-man advantage in the third period.</p>

<p>No sooner did Sharp knock home a second chance opportunity for the Blackhawks&apos; first power-play goal of the series coming on 5 on 4, Boychuk unleashed a bomb in the high slot 54 seconds later.</p>

<p>He was the few who showed grit, trying to spark some kind of rally.</p>

<h2 id="scf10" class="">Boston Bruins don&apos;t believe they have physical advantage over Chicago Blackhawks in Stanley Cup Final</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins do not believe they hold a physical advantage over the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>Boston greatly out muscled Chicago in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. This brought up the question whether the Bruins were frustrating the Blackhawks to cause a few heated scrums.</p>

<p><q>When you get to this level and this far in the playoffs, you don&apos;t get here without being tough,</q> Bruins defenseman Andrew Ference said. <q>To have as good a record as they&apos;ve had, they had a huge target on their back for the whole season. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a single guy that discounts their toughness at all.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins won multiple puck battles, including one where Paille stripped Dave Bolland at the end boards and turned it into a goal to give the Bruins a 1-0 lead in the second period.</p>

<p>The climax came with 11.9 seconds remaining in the game when Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara shoved down Blackhawks wing Bryan Bickell with one arm in a net front battle then wound up on top of him.</p>

<p><q>While we have a certain style to our game that&apos;s physical, any team that makes it to this point does as well,</q> Ference added. <q>You have to or else you would have never made it this far or been as successful as they have been.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf11" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Tyler Seguin continues to learn from Patrice Bergeron entering Game 4 of Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_tyler_seguin_continues_to_learn_from_patrice_bergeron_entering_game_4_of_stanley_cup_f.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-19T15:07-05:00" pubdate>June 19, 2013, 3:07 EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Boston Bruins right winger Tyler Seguin had a rough stretch offensively during the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old future superstar went six games without recording a point. His first came assisting on linemate Patrice Bergeron&apos;s overtime goal in the Bruins epic Game 7 comeback over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round.</p>

<p>Seguin was demoted down to the third line in the next round with Rich Peverley and Chris Kelly, but never found a level of consistency.</p>

<p>But even though Seguin was spotty on the stat sheet, he continued to work on the little things that sometimes go unnoticed.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;m still pretty young. It&apos;s my third year so I still have a lot to learn,</q> Seguin said. <q>Sometimes when things aren&apos;t going your way, you can do better in other areas. That&apos;s been my mentality. The majority of these playoffs, especially as of late, I&apos;ve just been working on the little things.</q></p>

<p>He strongly looks to Bergeron, one of the best two-way players in the game, for guidance.</p>

<p><q>I think he takes as much pride as scoring a goal, or the little details in his own end or faceoffs or all three zones,</q> Seguin added. <q> So I think you can see all that and learn from that and learn that all the little things usually is what makes it pay off in the end.</q></p>

<p>Seguin, who isn&apos;t known for landing punishing hits like Milan Lucic, or being a shot-block warrior like Gregory Campbell, has been mixing in these stats more and his work ethic is becoming more noticeable in the Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>Entering Game 4 Wednesday night, Seguin has a point in each game and is clicking with his new third linemates, Daniel Paille and Chris Kelly.</p>

<p><q>I think we&apos;re playing well, I think we&apos;re playing with confidence,</q> Seguin said about his line. <q>We&apos;re just working hard out there. We&apos;re getting rewarded. Obviously (Paille&apos;s) got a pretty hot stick right now so I think we just want to stay consistent with that.</q></p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien was forced to switch up the lines because of Campbell&apos;s season-ending leg injury suffered in Game 4 of the conference finals.</p>

<p>Julien saw something and went strictly based on coaching instinct.</p>

<p>For the most part, he&apos;s been impressed by Seguin&apos;s effort.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s played well. I said that the other day,</q> Julien said. <q>He&apos;s forechecked, done well in the battles as far as trying to come up with the puck, all the things we ask him to do. We&apos;re not expecting him to be a real physical player because we don&apos;t try to make a player what he&apos;s not.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf12" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Andrew Ference on Army Rangers: &apos;They deserve a lot more recognition than they get&apos;</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_andrew_ference_on_army_rangers_they_deserve_a_lot_more_recognition_than_they_get.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-19T13:30" pubdate>June 19, 2013, 1:30 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; By now, a lot of people are familiar with the Boston Bruins and the Army Ranger jacket that is awarded to the &apos;Player of Game,&apos; which started at the beginning of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference started the &apos;Player of the Game&apos; tradition back during the team&apos;s 2011 Cup run with the vintage Bruins Starter jacket he purchased on eBay.</p>

<p>In 2012 it was <q>The Chain.</q> The chain consisted of 20 links, which represented the 20 players. It was held together by a padlock with an engraved Bruins logo.</p>

<p>The Ranger jacket however brings out a whole new meaning and connection.</p>

<p>Ference met Army Ranger Lucas Carr through mutual friends while he was still serving.</p>

<p>Carr ran in this year&apos;s Boston Marathon and crossed the finish line a few minutes before the bombs went off.</p>

<p>After the Bruins won the Cup in 2011, Ference visited the Fort Benning base down in Georgia. It was there that he met a bunch of Carr&apos;s friends and his platoon.</p>

<p><q>We&apos;ve had a relationship with the rangers for number of years and I&apos;ve been friends with Lucas for a number of years,</q> Ference said. <q>Our last Stanley Cup run we were wearing the Rangers shirt, did a lot of stuff with them. They sent us a lot of pictures, texts, stuff like that, supporting us really well.</q></p>

<p>During his visit, Ference was able to put himself in the everyday lives of the Army Rangers, to see exactly what they go through in their training regiment.</p>

<p>Ference wasn&apos;t surrounded by any military presences in Canada where he grew up in the city of Edmonton, so this was a whole new experience.</p>

<p>At the base they gave him the jacket and sewed on the various unique patches, which include the Spoked-B logo, but most importantly, according to Ference the Ranger tab, which <q>people go through hell to earn.</q></p>

<p>Not only did Ference leave with an amazing gift, but the trip also gave him another view on life.</p>

<p><q>Seeing them leave for months and seeing him come back after losing friends, go through that, it makes it obviously a lot more personal and you see the emotional impact,</q> Ference said. <q>That&apos;s when it kind of turns from talking about their bravery to understanding it. Seeing the real side of it for myself and a lot of the guys.</q></p>

<p>Heading into Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks Wednesday night at TD Garden, 12 different Bruins have donned the jacket.</p>

<p>All year round, the team is heavily involved honoring the United States Armed Forces.</p>

<p>At every home game during the regular and playoff season, a different military member is recognized with an <q>8-Spoked Salute</q> on the Jumbotron during a game break.</p>

<p>The sellout crowd of 17,565 always erupts in a gracious applause and standing ovation while the Bruins and their opponent do a stick tap. Sometimes the military member will have their children with them or it&apos;ll be a group from the same regiment, which sparks a higher level of emotion.</p>

<p><q>Those guys I think appreciate the getaway that hockey gave them,</q> Ference said. &ldquo;To watch the games when they&apos;re serving, it&apos;s probably the best part of their day.</p>

<p><q>We don&apos;t try to equate ourselves with what they&apos;re doing, but we know that we&apos;re a good source of entertainment and something that they can rally around and have fun with. They really appreciated us recognizing them and what they do.</q></p>

<p>Ference said that Carr attends the games regularly and they&apos;ve been receiving messages from the guys down in Georgia and former rangers since the start of the playoffs.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s amazing when you hear from the guys ... seeing they&apos;re excited," Ference added. "They are guys that deserve a lot more recognition than they get.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf13" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; third line of Daniel Paille, Chris Kelly, Tyler Seguin key in Game 3 win of Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_third_line_of_daniel_paille_chris_kelly_tyler_seguin_key_in_game_3_win_of_stanley_cup.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-18T16:22-05:00" pubdate>June 18, 2013, 4:22 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>When Boston Bruins center Gregory Campbell went down for the remainder of the playoffs with a broken leg suffered in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference final, the question was who would step up to fill his absence.</p>

<p>After the Bruins&apos; 2-0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final Monday night, that question&apos;s been answered.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien&apos;s newly configured third line of Daniel Paille, Chris Kelly and Tyler Seguin is answering the bell as one of the reasons the Bruins lead the best-of-7 series 2-1.</p>

<p>The trio has eight points through the first three games.</p>

<p>Each player had a hand in Paille&apos;s goal at 2:13 of the second period, which put Boston on top 1-0.</p>

<p>It was Paille&apos;s second straight game-winning goal, and fourth goal of the playoffs.</p>

<p>After being heavily criticized for not putting up points, Seguin has assisted in every game vs. Chicago.</p>

<p>Kelly bounced back in a big way after an awful performance in Game 1, where he finished with a minus-3 rating in the Bruins&apos; 4-3 loss in triple overtime.</p>

<p>He netted his first playoff point on a goal in Game 2 and carried it over with a helper on Paille&apos;s strike Monday.</p>

<p><q>I think we are just moving well, and for the most part, we are holding on to the puck,</q> Paille said. <q>I think puck possession has been key for us especially. You really see (Tyler Seguin) moving his legs. That helps a lot.</q></p>

<p>It&apos;s not just offensively where they&apos;ve performed.</p>

<p>Paille and Kelly were also dominant on the penalty kill, logging 2:18 and 3:29 of ice time, respectively, as the Bruins went a perfect 5 for 5 in Game 3.</p>

<p>Boston has killed off 26 straight penalties dating to Game 5 of the conference semifinals against the New York Rangers.</p>

<p><q>It really got better as the playoffs went on. But we really picked it up against Pittsburgh for the same reasons, same kind of a dangerous power play,</q> Julien said. <q>Again, it just continues to give us some help in these games.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf14" class="">Boston Bruins rookie defenseman Dougie Hamilton motivated being healthy scratch in Stanley Cup Final</h2>

<p>The last time Boston Bruins rookie defenseman Dougie Hamilton saw action in the Stanley Cup playoffs was Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Rangers.</p>

<p>That was nearly a month ago.</p>

<p>Hamilton assisted on Tyler Seguin&apos;s first goal of the playoffs in the third period, which gave the Bruins a 3-2 lead before they fell 4-3 in overtime.</p>

<p>When Dennis Seidenberg returned from a lower-body injury for Game 5, Hamilton became the odd man out.</p>

<p>But that hasn&apos;t dashed his work ethic with the Bruins preparing for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final against the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>It&apos;s only motivated him.</p>

<p><q>We&apos;ve been skating with the team and doing extra after. It&apos;s hard work, but I think it&apos;s definitely good for you,</q> Hamilton said of being a healthy scratch. &ldquo;It&apos;s going to make me better ... work out and ride the bike.</p>

<p><q>I think everyone who&apos;s not been playing can kind of tell you that it&apos;s probably harder than playing, and it makes you want to get back in the lineup.</q></p>

<p>Hamilton has appeared in seven playoff games, tallying three assists.</p>

<p>He stepped in with fellow rookies Torey Krug and Matt Bartkowski when Seidenberg, Andrew Ference and Wade Redden suffered injuries in the first round.</p>

<h2 id="scf15" class="">Tuukka Rask posts 3rd playoff shutout to lead Boston Bruins to 2-0 win in Game 3 of Stanley Cup Final</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins were the complete package.</p>

<p>They scored a power-play goal, were perfect on the penalty-kill, fought, but most importantly scored.</p>

<p>Daniel Paille and Patrice Bergeron provided the offense while netminder Tuukka Rask and the strong defensive corps did the rest.</p>

<p>Rask posted his third shutout of the postseason to lead the Bruins over the Chicago Blackhawks, 2-0 in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final Monday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>The Bruins now lead the best-of-7 series 2-1.</p>

<p>Game 4 is Wednesday night at the Garden.</p>

<p>Rask finished with 28 saves in another solid performance.</p>

<p>He also had a lot of help from the Bruins defensive unit. who cleared the puck out of danger on every juicy rebound chance.</p>

<p><q>Tonight was great,</q> Rask said. &ldquo;If you take the first period out of (Game 2) I thought the last two periods in that game were really good and today we continued to do that.</p>

<p><q>(Chicago) had shots, but most of them came from the outside and we eliminated a lot of their rebound opportunities, so I think that&apos;s something every team likes to do and we succeeded.</q></p>

<p>The sellout crowd of 17,565 exploded and stood as one after the Bruins killed off center David Krejci&apos;s hooking penalty with two minutes remaining in the third period.</p>

<p><q>We want the Cup</q> chants followed.</p>

<p>It was Boston&apos;s fourth kill of the game and 26th straight of the playoffs.</p>

<p><q>We try to stay compact in our zone and once the puck is bobbled or if we see a chance to pressure we do that,</q> Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg said. <q>For the most part we&apos;ve been doing a good job keeping to the outside and try to go down low. And then there&apos;s Tuukka. He always seems to make that save and we try to clean up for him to get the rebound.</q></p>

<p>With Chicago goalie Corey Crawford (33 saves) pulled for the extra attacker with a minute to play, things got heated in the Bruins&apos; zone while the Blackhawks pressured.</p>

<p>With 11.9 seconds left, Bruins captain Zdeno Chara and Blackhawks wing Bryan Bickell engaged in a scrum.</p>

<p>Agitators Brad Marchand and Andrew Shaw also squared off. Marchand easily got flattened on his backside.</p>

<p><q>Just a battle in front of the net,</q> Chara said about the scrap. <q>(It&apos;s) part of the game.</q></p>

<p>Besides Rask, the story was the dominant play of the Bruins&apos; third line.</p>

<p>The combination of Paille, Chris Kelly and Tyler Seguin carried their momentum from Game 2 and connected in the second period.</p>

<p>Paille striped the puck off Dave Bolland&apos;s stick at the end boards, controlled, and sniped it glove side past Crawford at 4:13 for a 1-0 lead.</p>

<p>Kelly and Seguin were credited with assists.</p>

<p><q>They played a strong game,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>They skated hard, kept the game simple and that&apos;s what you want from guys who haven&apos;t played with each other. It&apos;s about playing basic hockey, get pucks deep, forechecking, getting pucks to the net. They&apos;ve done a good job working as a unit and communicating out there.</q></p>

<p>Bolland had a miserable night. He found himself in the penalty box three times, twice for tripping and a cross-check infraction.</p>

<p>It was Paille&apos;s fourth of the playoffs in 19 games. Entering this season, it took him his first 46 career playoff games to score four goals.</p>

<p>Paille was a warrior. He was simply doing it all for the Bruins on the ice whether it was shorthanded, even-strength, or man advantage.</p>

<p>He drove to the net and drew a tripping call on Niklas Hjalmarsson, while the Bruins were already on the power play.</p>

<p>Fifteen seconds later and 11 seconds after the first Blackhawks penalty expired, Bergeron struck home Jaromir Jagr&apos;s feed from the right corner to give the Bruins a 2-0 lead at 14:05 of the second period.</p>

<p>Bergeron was perfectly placed to Crawford&apos;s right and banged home a quick tape-to-tape pass that whizzed by Blackhawks defenseman Brent Seabrook and Bruins winger Milan Lucic, who were battling in front.</p>

<p>Seconds after a Blackhawks&apos; power-play chance expired, Marchand nearly put the Bruins on the board with four minutes left in the first period, but wasn&apos;t able to settle down a rolling puck.</p>

<p>The Bruins penalty-kill unit got in some work twice in the period, but remained unscathed.</p>

<p>They were on a questionable roughing call on Shawn Thornton and Kaspars Daugavins (roughing) which both involved Blackhawks pest Andre Shaw.</p>

<p>Rask snared blueliner Duncan Keith&apos;s shot with a quick glove work at the 12:45 mark of the first period.</p>

<p>The Bruins&apos; physical presence was known early and often.</p>

<p>Rookie defenseman Torey Krug executed a strong back check on Blackhawks wing Ben Smith to regain possession of the puck after turning the puck over midway through the first period.</p>

<p>The generously listed 5-foot-9 Krug has been impressive with his height disadvantage.</p>

<p>Bergeron had a good look on Crawford and tried a backhand attempt, but was smothered at the 4:44 mark of the first period.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Blackhawks winger Marian Hossa didn&apos;t play because of an apparent injury he suffered in pregame warmups. Former Boston College Eagle Ben Smith made his 2013 NHL playoff debut ... Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara and winger Milan Lucic collided in warmups, but were both OK ... Bruins fans are leading in the annual Beard-A-Thon, which raises funds for NHL team charities. They&apos;ve raised a total of $107,385 so far and counting.</p>

<h2 id="scf16" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Dougie Hamilton recalls Stanley Cup Final experience as top prospect</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_defenseman_dougie_hamilton_recalls_stanley_cup_final_experience_as_top_prospect.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-17T16:00-05:00" pubdate>June 17, 2013, 4:00 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Two years ago Boston Bruins defenseman Dougie Hamilton attended Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final as a high-level prospect.</p>

<p>Now the 19-year-old is in midst of it with the Bruins facing the Chicago Blackhawks in the best-of-7 series.</p>

<p><q>I never thought I was going to be here,</q> Hamilton said who was drafted at No. 9 overall in 2011. &ldquo;I was lucky to come to Boston for Game 3 two years ago and be able to watch that, really kind of soak it in.</p>

<p><q>That was kind of my first time being in Boston seeing the rink and seeing the city and everything too so I look back on that day a lot as I&apos;m walking around the rink or walking around the city.</q></p>

<p>For the last 20 years, it&apos;s been a tradition at the Cup Final to invite the year&apos;s top draft picks.</p>

<p>Hamilton witnessed the Bruins pounce on the Vancouver Canucks, 8-1 at TD Garden. It was the game where right winger Nathan Horton went down with a concussion only minutes into the first period.</p>

<p><q>It was insane,</q> Hamilton said of the experience. <q>I think the fans were standing for 10 minutes straight in the first period cheering.</q></p>

<p>Monday night at TD Garden for Game 3, the league&apos;s projected top picks were in attendance and seen conversing with Bruins and Blackhawks players in their respected locker room after morning skate.</p>

<p>They included Seth Jones (Portland, Western Hockey League), Nathan MacKinnon (Halifax, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League), Jonathan Droulin (Halifax, QMJHL) and Darnell Nurse (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Hockey League).</p>

<p>The group was spotted talking with Bruins right winger Tyler Seguin who was in the same position in 2010 before the Bruins selected him No. 2 overall in that summer&apos;s draft with the pick they received from the Phil Kessel trade in 2009.</p>

<p>Seguin saw the Blackhawks face the Philadelphia Flyers who went on to win the series in six games.</p>

<p>He had some words of encouragement for the foursome.</p>

<p><q>He just said enjoy it,</q> Jones said who is expected to go first overall. <q>Obviously he did the same thing we did with Don Cherry on &lsquo;Coaches Corner,&rsquo; so we share some similarities there.</q></p>

<p><q>Coaches Corner</q> is a segment which follows the first intermission of every game on Hockey Night in Canada.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s cool knowing that you have guys that did the same thing that you did,</q> Jones added. <q>Kind of went down the same path that you have to go down one day.</q></p>

<p>Other current players who were guests at the Cup Final in their draft years were Bruins forward Nathan Horton (2003) and defenseman Wade Redden (1995) and Blackhawks Jonathan Toews (2006) and Patrick Kane (2007).</p>

<p>If Jones is selected first, he&apos;ll make history becoming the first half African-American to accomplish that feat.</p>

<p>He&apos;ll also join a small group of players who include Bryan Berard (1995), Rick DiPietro (2000), Erik Johnson (2006) and Patrick Kane (2007) as the only Americans to be selected No. 1 overall over the past 20 years.</p>

<p>Jones is a native of Frisco, Texas.</p>

<p>His father, Popeye Jones, is a retired NBA player and currently the assistant coach of the Brooklyn Nets.</p>

<p>He had a stint with the Celtics in the 1998-99 season, playing in 18 games.</p>

<p>MacKinnon and Droulin helped lead the Mooseheads to their first Memorial Cup title in franchise history, as they beat the Portland Winterhawks (WHL), 6-4 in the final of the four-team round robin tournament.</p>

<p>MacKinnon, a center, led the tournament in scoring with 13 points, including a hat trick in the championship and was named the Most Valuable Player.</p>

<p>Droulin, a left wing, posted a career-high 105 points during the regular season to be named the QMJHL&apos;s MVP and Best Professional Prospect and Personality of the Year.</p>

<p>Nurse, a defenseman, completed his second season in the OHL. He led the Greyhounds with 116 penalty minutes and was second on the team with a plus-15 rating.</p>

<h2 id="scf17" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara a true workhorse in Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_defenseman_zdeno_chara_a_true_workhorse_in_stanley_cup_final.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-17T14:45-05:00" pubdate>June 17, 2013, 2:45 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; When it comes to ice time, no one comes close to Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara.</p>

<p>The Bruins captain has been quite busy this postseason with his team playing in five overtime games, including a double and triple session.</p>

<p>Chara logged 30:58 of ice time in Boston&apos;s 2-1 overtime win in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final against the Blackhawks Saturday to give him a grand total of 545:45 minutes through 18 playoff games.</p>

<p>He is averaging 30:19 per game, which includes 3:20 of shorthanded play and 2:44 on the power play.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s pretty impressive,</q> fellow defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>He&apos;s in good shape. I&apos;m glad that he keeps himself in that good of shape. He&apos;s one of the best (defensemen) in the league, if not, the best defenseman so I&apos;m happy to have him on our side.</q></p>

<p>Defenseman Drew Doughty of the Los Angeles Kings is second at 503:10 (27:57 average). The next active player is Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith who has 492:08 (27:20) heading into Game 3.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s our top defensemen and he&apos;s playing top minutes and shutting down other lines and doing well when he gets a chance offensively,</q> Boychuk added. <q>He&apos;s our captain, he&apos;s our team leader and he&apos;s been doing a great job throughout the whole year.</q></p>

<p>Chara is paired with Dennis Seidenberg who also logs a ton of minutes. Together they serve as one of the best 1-2 defensive punches in the league.</p>

<p>Seidenberg finished at an even 31:00 of play for Game 2. He led the Bruins with a whopping 48:36 in Game 1&apos;s 4-3 triple overtime loss.</p>

<p><strong>KREJCI VERSATILE:</strong> With Gregory Campbell out with a broken leg, center David Krejci has been filling in on the penalty-kill unit.</p>

<p>Krejci logged 2:20 of shorthanded time in Game 2 to help the Bruins kill off all three of Chicago&apos;s power-play attempts.</p>

<p>Through two games, Boston is a perfect 6 for 6 on the penalty-kill.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s done great,</q> Bruins winger Brad Marchand said. <q>He&apos;s played penalty-kill in the past so he&apos;s able to come in and play well. When you have a guy that&apos;s as (versatile) as Dave they can play in every situation, you don&apos;t have to worry about that. He&apos;s always great defensively in our end during the season so he fits well.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf18" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Brad Marchand on Chris Kelly: &lsquo;We give it to each other pretty good&rsquo;</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_brad_marchand_on_chris_kelly_we_give_it_to_each_other_pretty_good.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-17T14:26-05:00" pubdate>June 17, 2013, 2:26 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; When Boston Bruins center Chris Kelly speaks to the media, he comes across as a very quiet and reserved guy. But behind closed doors, it&apos;s a whole other story.</p>

<p>According to his teammates, Kelly isn&apos;t the guy he plays out to be. However it&apos;s not in a bad way.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s a great guy. He&apos;s a lot of fun to be around,</q> Bruins forward Brad Marchand said prior to Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. <q>We give it to each other pretty good. He&apos;s always talking and laughing and joking around. He puts on a good front for the media and the public, but behind closed doors he&apos;s a funny guy.</q></p>

<p>Defenseman Dennis Seidenberg said that Kelly is a <q>loud-mouth,</q> which Marchand confirmed.</p>

<p><q>Yeah he is, there&apos;s no doubt about that,</q> Marchand smiled. <q>Especially on the plane, you can hear him all the way in the back and the front, he&apos;s a good guy to have around.</q></p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien said that Kelly is very demanding of himself and has a temper, but a good one.</p>

<p><q>When we&apos;re not having a good practice, there&apos;s a lot of times you&apos;ll hear him chirp before you&apos;ll hear me,</q> Julien said. <q>That&apos;s the kind of leadership he brings.</p>

<p><q>Although he feels it&apos;s been a little bit tougher for him this year because he hasn&apos;t had the kind of year he would like ... I told him it was important that he continues to be a leader.</q></p>

<p>Kelly got Boston on the board in Game 2 to tie the game at 1 at 14:58 of the second period. It was his first point of the playoffs and couldn&apos;t have come at the most crucial of times.</p>

<p>The Bruins won the game, 2-1 in overtime as Paille netted the winner to split the first two games of the best-of-7 series in Chicago.</p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; With the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final in Chicago, the Boston Bruins traveled without injured center Gregory Campbell.</p>

<p>Campbell, who will go down in Bruins&apos; playoff history as the guy who remained on the ice after breaking his right leg to finish his shift on the penalty-kill, was missed by his teammates.</p>

<p>He was back at TD Garden for Game 3 against the Blackhawks Monday night.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s great,</q> Bruins winger Brad Marchand said about seeing Campbell. <q>He&apos;s such a big part of our team. We wouldn&apos;t be where we are now if he wasn&apos;t here so it&apos;s great to be around him again.</q></p>

<p>A similar episode happened two years ago with winger Nathan Horton who missed the remainder of the Cup Final against Vancouver after being concussed by defenseman Aaron Rome in Game 3.

<p><q>Every time that someone goes down, you always want to play for that player,</q> Bruins winger Daniel Paille said. <q>Right now (Campbell) we know he&apos;s done everything he did to help us get to where we&apos;re at and we always want to make sure that it wasn&apos;t for nothing.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins split the first two games of the best-of-7 series in the windy city.</p>

<p>Chicago is 0-3 in Game 3s this postseason while Boston is 3-0, but that doesn&apos;t matter to coach Claude Julien.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;m going to tell you the same thing that I told everybody when we asked those questions about not being able to close, this and that. Stats at this time of year don&apos;t mean a thing," Julien said. "No matter what we are, what they are, it&apos;s about winning this game tonight.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf20" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Nathan Horton practices; not ruled out for Game 2 of Stanley Cup Final</h2>

<p>Boston Bruins right winger Nathan Horton practiced with the team Friday at the United Center in Chicago.</p>

<p>Horton left Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final against Chicago in the first overtime period with an upper-body injury after being tangled with Blackhawks defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson while fighting for control of the puck.</p>

<p>He skated off the ice hunched over, headed straight down the tunnel and never returned for another shift.</p>

<p>Late Thursday a report broke out that Horton is dealing with a chronic shoulder issue, which was originally suffered back on April 20 after a fight with Pittsburgh Penguins counterpart Jarome Iginla.</p>

<p>According to the report, Horton has received shots before each game to deal with the pain and this isn&apos;t the first time his shoulder has popped out during the Bruins&apos; Cup run.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien said that Horton&apos;s status still remains day-to-day and didn&apos;t rule him out for Game 2 Saturday.</p>

<p>Tyler Seguin also took line rushes on the top line with winger Milan Lucic and David Krejci.</p>

<p>The second line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Jaromir Jagr remained intact.</p>

<p>Carl Soderberg, Daniel Paille, Jordan Caron, and Rich Peverley all rotated on the third line while the fourth line consisted of Kaspars Daugavins, Chris Kelly and Shawn Thornton.</p>

<p>The Boston Marathon bombing was one of the most tragic events in recent history our nation has faced due to an act of terrorism since 9-11.</p>

<p>Even though the entire country rallied in support of Boston, unfortunately there have been some people who haven&apos;t made wise decisions.</p>

<p>A Toronto Maple Leafs fan received an incredible amount of backlash for a sign reading <q>Toronto Stronger</q> he held up during Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the Boston Bruins.</p>

<p>The sign mocked the slogan <q>Boston Strong,</q> which has been the theme of the city and used by its sports teams.</p>

<p>The Bruins decided to honor the victims of the Marathon bombings by carrying the <q>Boston Strong</q> theme for their Fan Banner Captains who are traditionally Team Alumni.</p>

<p>Apparently a certain Chicago T-shirt company missed this and decided to take the <q>Strong</q> theme to a whole new level.</p>

<p>Cubby Tees, a sports apparel company based in Chicago, created a T-shirt with the slogan, <q>Chicago Stronger,</q> that has sparked outrage across the board ranging from Boston sports blogs and the social media website Twitter.</p>

<p>Boston Sports Then and Now first reported about the T-shirt on their website Thursday.</p>

<p>Fans ripped the company calling the T-shirt and anyone who tweeted out the hashtag <q>chicagostronger,</q> <q>classless,</q> <q>disrespectful,</q> and <q>idiotic,</q> to name a few.</p>

<p>By Friday morning, the company pulled the T-shirt and released a statement, which never mentions the word <q>apologize,</q> or <q>sorry.</q></p>

<p>Here&apos;s an excerpt of the statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Though we: (a) are loathe to take any action that appears to bow to bullying, and; (b) had hoped that residents of the &ldquo;Cradle Of Liberty&rdquo; held a greater appreciation for the freedom of expression (we support you venting your opinions, not so much your threats and insistence on censorship) ... we&apos;ve nevertheless pulled the shirt in the interest of harmony between two great cities.</p></blockquote>

<p>The company began its message saying it wished more had read the description under the T-shirt, which stated the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>Following the tragedy of the Boston Marathon bombing, the nation rallied around Beantown and its <q>Boston Strong</q> motto, which has since been appropriated by its sports fans. We love Boston and support/admire its people, but can&apos;t stomach this use of the nation&apos;s sympathy or believe that the homicidal lunacy of two disturbed locals has rendered its teams invincible.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&apos;s not all Bruins fans should be upset about.</p>

<p>Wednesday the Chicago Tribune printed a tweaked version of their original tribute, which renamed their sports teams We Are Chicago Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, Patriots, and Revolution.</p>

<p>This one had a hand ripping out the Bruins print from the page with the caption <q>Yeah, not right now we&apos;re not.</q></p>

<h2 id="scf22" class="">Boston Bruins cannot afford to lose Nathan Horton long-term in Stanley Cup Final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_cannot_afford_to_lose_nathan_horton_long-term_in_stanley_cup_final.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-14T08:00-05:00" pubdate>June 14, 2013, 8:00 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>There was a sigh of relief when Boston Bruins coach Claude Julien said Thursday that right winger Nathan Horton is listed as day-to-day with hope of him returning for Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final Saturday at the United Center.</p>

<p>Horton suffered an upper-body injury in the first overtime period of the Bruins&apos; 4-3 loss in triple OT Wednesday night in Game 1 against the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>Horton got tangled with Blackhawks defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson while fighting for control of the puck.</p>

<p>He skated off the ice hunched over, headed straight down the tunnel and never returned for another shift.</p>

<p>If Horton is indeed back for Game 2, the Bruins will have dodged a major bullet.</p>

<p>However now there are reports saying Horton is dealing with a chronic shoulder issue, which was originally suffered back on April 20 when he fought Pittsburgh Penguins forward Jarome Iginla.</p>

<p>According to the report, Horton has received shots before each game to deal with the pain and this isn&apos;t the first time his shoulder has popped out during the Bruins&apos; Cup run.</p>

<p>His absence would greatly impact Boston&apos;s red-hot top line, of Horton, center David Krejci and left winger Milan Lucic.</p>

<p>The trio has combined for 57 points this postseason. Horton has 18. He is also the playoff leader with a plus-22 rating in 17 games.</p>

<p>With Gregory Campbell out for the rest of the playoffs with a broken leg, the Bruins are already thin at the forward position.</p>

<p>Kaspars Daugavins is skating in Campbell&apos;s spot, but hasn&apos;t seen much action.</p>

<p>He only logged 15:09 of ice time out of a possible 112:08 in Game 1, which was the second lowest on the team.</p>

<p>Forward Shawn Thornton finished with only 9:55.</p>

<p>Daugavins had a chance to be a hero at the halfway point of the third overtime, but fanned on a backhand attempt in front of an open net.</p>

<p>He was clearly frustrated with himself as the camera caught him with his head down on the bench digesting what just happened.</p>

<p>If Horton isn&apos;t ready for Game 2 there are a couple of options.</p>

<p>Tyler Seguin would likely move up to Horton&apos;s slot like he did for the remainder of Game 1 and Jordan Caron would dress.</p>

<p>Seguin has yet to break out from his funk, so the idea of him playing on the top line is sadly not ideal or optimistic.</p>

<p>It&apos;s highly unlikely that either Jay Pandolfo or Carl Soderberg will be called upon.</p>

<p>Soderberg is not ready to be thrown into this situation. Not the Stanley Cup Final.</p>

<p>He only played in six NHL regular season games and needs time to adjust.</p>

<p>Caron has minimal NHL playoff experience. He played in Games 6 and 7 of the first round series against the Washington Capitals last season where the Bruins lost the best-of-7 series.</p>

<p>He spent most of his time down in Boston&apos;s AHL-affiliate Providence this season. In the Calder Cup playoffs, Caron finished with two goals and seven assists with a plus-5 rating.</p>

<p>The P-Bruins lost in the Eastern Conference semifinal against Wilkes-Barre Scranton after holding a 3-0 series lead.</p>

<p>Julien could also dress Torey Krug as a seventh-defenseman and utilize him on the power play while Wade Redden or Matt Bartkowski takes his spot.</p>

<p>That probably won&apos;t happen, but it is an option.</p>

<p>Or just do what the Bruins are doing, <q>keep your fingers crossed Horton will be back next game.</q></p>

<p>On a serious note, if Horton&apos;s injury is more severe than originally thought, this could be it for him wearing a Black and Gold sweater. He is set to be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.</p>

<p>There&apos;s been some debate whether or not Horton will be resigned or rather if the Bruins can afford to resign him and still be cap compliant.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old currently makes $5.5 million with a cap hit of $4 million.</p>

<p>If the Bruins want to keep Horton, it may mean parting with other players.</p>

<p>With poor performances through the regular and postseason, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if either Chris Kelly ($3 million cap hit) or Rich Peverley ($3.25 million) are traded this summer.</p>

<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference ($2.25 million) is another guy scheduled to be a UFA on July 1.</p>

<p>This may all depend on the outcome of the Cup Final.</p>

<p>By now we all have had some time to digest the Boston Bruins&apos; painful 4-3 triple overtime loss to Chicago in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final Wednesday night. Or rather early Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Somehow Boston managed to blow a two-goal lead, twice, and Blackhawks winger Andrew Shaw finished the job in the sixth period.</p>

<p>Milan Lucic&apos;s two-goal performance was overshadowed by a costly turnover in the neutral zone (Torey Krug), an unlucky bounce (Andrew Ference), and a slew of missed opportunities (Tyler Seguin, David Krejci, Kaspars Daugavins), which would have given the Bruins a 1-0 lead in the best-of-7 series.</p>

<p>Instead, the Bruins have to put Game 1 behind them, focus on what they did wrong and not to repeat it in Game 2 set for Saturday at the United Center.</p>

<p>Here are some thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Should coach Claude Julien stick with rookie wonder Krug or switch back to Wade Redden?</strong></p>

<p>Until Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final, there wasn&apos;t any uneasiness or doubt about Krug&apos;s play.</p>

<p>But his inexperience finally showed with a <q>terrible turnover</q> dubbed by Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask.</p>

<p>Krug tried to clear the puck from his own zone while there was a line change. Instead the puck found Andrew Shaw&apos;s stick in the neutral zone, which led to Dave Bolland&apos;s goal at 8:00 of the third period to cut the deficit to 3-2.</p>

<p>It was the first time in nine games Krug was on the ice for an opposing goal, which is pretty impressive for a guy who played in the American Hockey League all season with no NHL playoff experience.</p>

<p>He finished the game a minus-2 as he was also on for Shaw&apos;s game-winner.</p>

<p>Julien benched Krug for the remainder of the period and he didn&apos;t see action until three minutes into the first overtime.</p>

<p>Krug is valuable on the Bruins&apos; second power-play unit. So unless he makes another costly mistake, Julien may stick with him for now.</p>

<p><strong>Nathan Horton day-to-day</strong></p>

<p>The Bruins may have dodged a bullet with Horton who left during the first overtime period with an upper-body injury.</p>

<p>Julien said Thursday the winger is <q>day-to-day</q> and that the team is <q>keeping our fingers crossed he&apos;ll be back next game.</q></p>

<p>Too many missed opportunities for Tyler Seguin.</p>
Sorry Tyler, but this is ridiculous. When are you going to step up and bury pucks in the net?</p>

<p>You were the No. 2 overall pick in 2010 because the Bruins saw potential of you becoming an elite goa scorer. But for some reason when it&apos;s playoff time, you&apos;re nearly invisible.</p>

<p>You have the skill, speed and talent to be a great hockey player and Wednesday night, you had more than one opportunity to be a hero.</p>

<p>Since your two-goal, four-point breakout in Game 2 of the 2011 Eastern Conference final against Tampa Bay, you have three goals and six assists in his last 35 playoff games.</p>

<p>That&apos;s inexcusable.</p>

<p>If Horton can&apos;t go for Game 2 the Bruins will be in trouble if Seguin can&apos;t fill his role.</p>

<p><strong>Corey Crawford is the real deal.</strong>
<p>This is not James Reimer, dare I say Henrik Lundqvist or Tomas Vokoun the Bruins are dealing with.</p>

<p>Crawford put on a show. He made numerous key saves and was the difference in each overtime.</p>

<p>Way back in the first period, Crawford robbed Bruins left winger Brad Marchand with quick glove work on a nasty wrister.</p>

<p>That save says it all about Crawford. It&apos;s going to take more creativity and grittiness from the Bruins to score on him.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Kelly and Rich Peverley, downright awful.</strong>
<p>What happened to Kelly and Peverley? The 2011 Stanley Cup warriors have been dreadful all season but even worse this postseason.</p>

<p>Kelly hasn&apos;t recorded a point in 20 games dating back to April 21 against the Florida Panthers. He is a minus-9 in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Peverley is pointless in his last 14 games with a minus-6 rating in 16 games.</p>

<p>The two combined for a minus-5 in Game 1.</p>

<p>Kelly, a center, couldn&apos;t even do the little things right like winning faceoffs. He finished at 32 percent (7 for 22).</p>

<p>The Bruins have been able to win despite Kelly and Peverley&apos;s poor performance, but this trend cannot keep going if Boston wants to win the Cup.</p>

<h2 id="scf24" class="">Selke Trophy finalist Patrice Bergeron pivotal piece in Boston Bruins&apos; Stanley Cup run</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/selke_trophy_finalist_patrice_bergeron_pivotal_piece_in_boston_bruins_stanley_cup_run.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time dtatetime="2013-06-11T16:25-05:00" pubdate>June 11, 2013, 4:25 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>There are many reasons why the Boston Bruins are in the Stanley Cup Final for the second time in three years.</p>

<p>One is Patrice Bergeron.</p>

<p>The Bruins are looking for their center to continue his dominant play against the Blackhawks as the best-of-7 series kicks off Wednesday at the United Center in Chicago.</p>

<p>The Bruins alternate captain is having another successful playoff run. He has 11 points in 17 games and has served as a scoring threat in key situations.</p>

<p>Bergeron had the game-tying and winning goals after Nathan Horton and Milan Lucic chipped away at a three-goal deficit in Game 7 of the first round series against Toronto.</p>

<p>Against Pittsburgh in the conference final, Bergeron scored in double overtime as Boston took a 3-0 series lead.</p>

<p>He also set up linemate Brad Marchand&apos;s OT winner in Game 1 of the conference semifinal against the New York Rangers.</p>

<p>What&apos;s so admirable about Bergeron is how selfless he is. He always puts his teammates first. One look at his battered and bruised face only supports that notion.</p>

<p>When asked about the overtime winner against the Penguins, Bergeron immediately credited linemate Jaromir Jagr for fighting to gain control of the puck.</p>

<p><q>(Bergeron) does everything right,</q> Marchand said after the Bruins&apos; 2-1 double-overtime win. <q>And it&apos;s little things that make him such a great player.</q></p>

<p>Those little things include winning puck battles along the boards, strong forechecking and dominance in the faceoff circle.</p>

<p>Bergeron&apos;s 61 percent success rate in the dot (210 of 344 attempts) tops the league.</p>

<p>The 2012 Selke Trophy winner and 2013 finalist is one of the best two-way players in the NHL.</p>

<p>It was obvious how much the Bruins missed a healthy Bergeron in the 2011-12 playoffs.</p>

<p>Bergeron played with a torn oblique muscle, which he suffered in Game 3 of their first round series with the Washington Capitals. He aggravated it in Game 5, but was never scratched.</p>

<p>The severity of the injury affected him greatly.</p>

<p>He took just two draws &mdash; winning both in Games 6 and 7 &mdash; and wasn&apos;t able to stretch out far enough to score the potential game-winner in overtime in Game 7. Instead the Capitals got a 2 on 1 break, which led to Joel Ward&apos;s goal to eliminate Boston.</p>

<p>Bergeron is already in an elite class, but has a chance to make himself stand out even more.</p>

<p>He is one of just 11 players in NHL history to have two or more goals in a Stanley Cup Final Game 7.</p>

<p>He is also the 25th member of the International Ice Hockey Federation&apos;s Triple Gold Club winning a Stanley Cup, World Championship and Olympic Gold.</p>

<p>At 27, Bergeron is in the prime of his career.</p>

<p>He is signed through the 2013-14 season with a cap hit of $5 million.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no doubt the team will do anything and everything to make sure he stays a Bruin.</p>

<p>But first there&apos;s more business to attend to.</p>

<h2 id="scf25" class="">Keys to the Boston Bruins-Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup Final: Watch out for Bryan Bickell</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/keys_to_the_boston_bruins-chicago_blackhawks_stanley_cup_final_watch_out_for_bryan_bickell.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-11T14:37-05:00" pubdate>June 11, 2013, 2:37 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Bruins and Blackhawks have never met in the Stanley Cup Final, but have faced each other in the playoffs six times.</p>

<p>Boston is 17-4 lifetime against Chicago with a 5-1 series record.</p>

<p>Because of the lockout, they didn&apos;t meet during the regular season.</p>

<p>Chicago dispatched the Minnesota Wild (4-1), Detroit Red Wings (4-3) and Los Angeles Kings (4-1) to advance to their second final in four years. They won it in 2010 in six games over the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>

<p>Boston is looking for its second title in three years.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown:</p>

<strong>FORWARDS</strong>

<p><b>Chicago:</b> Marian Hossa, Patrick Sharp and Patrick Kane are tied for the team-lead with 17 points apiece. After breaking a seven-game goal drought in Game 4, Kane unleashed a hat trick in Chicago&apos;s 4-3 double overtime win in Game 5 to clinch the Western Conference Final. Captain Jonathan Toews has only one goal in the playoffs. Bryan Bickell is another guy to watch. He finished with seven points and a plus-5 against Los Angeles. He played on the top line with Kane and Toews in Games 4 and 5 ,however, Chicago was mixing and matching its top six forwards in practice Tuesday.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> The second line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Jaromir Jagr had a strong series against Pittsburgh. They combined for 11 points and a plus-13. David Krejci continued his playoff tear with four goals and was a plus-5. He still leads the league with 21 points, which is four points better than linemate Nathan Horton who ranks second. Horton (+21), Krejci (+14) and Milan Lucic (+13) are a plus-58 combined.</p>

<strong>DEFENSEMEN</strong>

<p><b>Chicago:</b> Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook are the top defensive pairing. Keith is fifth on the team in scoring with 11 points (two goals, nine assists) and averages 25:31 of ice time. He was suspended one game for high-sticking Kings forward Jeff Carter in the face in Game 3. The second pairing of Niklas Hjalmarsson (22:13) and Johnny Oduya (21:35) is first and second on the team in plus/minus at plus-10 and plus-9, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Dennis Seidenberg and Andrew Ference didn&apos;t miss a beat returning from their injuries in the conference final. Seidenberg finished a plus-5 while Ference was a plus-3. Zdeno Chara is continuing to log big minutes with an average of 29:21 for the postseason. Rookie Torey Krug remained pivotal with a key assist on Horton&apos;s goal in Game 2, which gave the Bruins a 2-0 lead in the first period.</p>

<strong>SPECIAL TEAMS</strong>

<p><b>Chicago:</b> The Blackhawks are 12th in the league with a 13.7 percent success-rate (7 for 51) on the power play with one shorthanded goal allowed. They went 1 for 14 against Los Angeles. It&apos;s the exact opposite on the penalty kill. Chicago is nearly perfect at 94.8 percent (55-for-58) with one shorthanded goal allowed.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> After scoring four power-play goals against New York in the conference semifinal, Boston&apos;s man-advantage woes struck again as it went 0 for 13 against Pittsburgh. The Bruins are 10th in the playoffs with a 15.6 percent success rate (7 for 45), with one short-handed goal allowed. The penalty-kill unit went 15 for 15, even after losing Gregory Campbell, who broke his leg in Game 3 while on the PK. Overall, the Bruins are sixth at 86.5 percent (45 for 52), with one short-handed goal.</p>

<strong>GOALIES</strong>

<p><b>Chicago:</b> Corey Crawford is legit. He leads the league with a 1.74 goals-against average and is second with a .935 save percentage. Against Los Angeles, Crawford sported a 1.82 GAA and .927 save percentage. He allowed four goals once through 17 starts and posted one shutout, which came in Game 4 of the conference quarterfinals against Minnesota.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Tuukka Rask was the difference against Pittsburgh. He allowed only two goals in four games with two shutouts. He sported a .985 save percentage and 0.44 GAA. Overall Rask tops the league with a .943 save percentage and is second behind Crawford in GAA at 1.75.</p>

<strong>PREDICTION:</strong> Bruins in 6.

<h2 id="ecf2" class="">Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask and penalty-killers lethal mix for Pittsburgh Penguins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_goalie_tuukka_rask_and_penalty-killers_lethal_mix_for_pittsburgh_penguins_to_handle.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-08T16:01-05:00" pubdate>June 8, 2013, 4:01 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Before the start of the Eastern Conference finals, it was a given the Boston Bruins had a huge advantage in goaltending.</p>

<p>But no one expected this from Tuukka Rask.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s been playing phenomenal,</q> Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>He gives us a chance to win every night even we&apos;re not playing at our best. He&apos;s Tuukka.</q></p>

<p>Rask finished the four-game sweep in the best-of-7 series over the Pittsburgh Penguins Friday night at TD Garden allowing just two goals to set a new club record to help the Bruins advance to the Stanley Cup Final for the second time in three years.</p>

<p>The previous best was five allowed to the Montreal Maroons in the 1930 semifinals and Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1969 quarterfinals.</p>

<p>What makes it more gratifying, no one named Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, James Neal, Jarome Iginla, or Pascal Dupuis scored. None of them registered any points.</p>

<p>Brandon Sutter and Chris Kunitz were the goal scorers in Games 2 and 3, respectively. Paul Martin was the lone Penguin to have two points.</p>

<p>Rask stopped 133 of 135 shots for an impeccable .985 save percentage and 0.44 goals-against average to go along with two shutouts.</p>

<p>The last Bruins goalie to post two shutouts in a playoff series was Tim Thomas in the 2011 Stanley Cup Final against Vancouver where he blanked the Canucks in Games 4 and 7.

<p>And Rask wasn&apos;t named a Vezina Trophy finalist?</p>

<p><q>I saw the replay the one Malkin had at the end there,</q> Bruins left wing Brad Marchand said about the scrum in the final seconds of the Boston&apos;s 1-0 Game 4 win. <q>It was incredible.</q></p>

<p>The mix of Rask and a fierce penalty-kill unit doomed the high-power Penguins&apos; offense which finished 0 for 15 on the power play.</p>

<p><q>It was a good team effort throughout each game,</q> Boychuk said. <q>We didn&apos;t expect to hold them to two goals in four games. They hit a couple posts, we got a couple good bounces and both teams worked hard.</q></p>

<p><strong>NORRIS TROPHY?</strong> During the first round of the playoffs, Penguins defenseman Kris Letang was named a Norris Trophy finalist. But facing the Bruins, he didn&apos;t give any indication why he deserved to be nominated for such a prestigious honor.</p>

<p>Letang was neither a defensive or offensive threat and was in the middle of plenty of bad plays.</p>

<p>He finished the series a minus-5 with zero points. Letang entered with 16 points, which included a league leading nine power-play points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara was a major obstacle for the Penguins to handle and logged big minutes. He&apos;s currently averaging 29:21 for the postseason.</p>

<p>Chara constantly broke up plays and made life miserable for Crosby, knocking down the Penguins captain several times and stealing the puck away.</p>

<p><q>We were committed to do the little things and really buy into our structure,</q> Chara said. <q>Let&apos;s not kid ourselves, they have the best offense in the world and they have an unbelievable team. They probably deserved better, but we were just playing under our game-plan.</q></p>

<p><strong>TURNING POINT:</strong> If there was any turning point for either team in the series, it happened with nine seconds left in the first period of Game 2.</p>

<p>After Sutter potted Pittsburgh&apos;s first goal of the series to give his team life with 34 seconds left, Marchand answered back with his second strike of the game to make it 4-1.</p>

<p>Whether the Penguins would admit it or not, that goal deflated any level of confidence they gained in those few moments.</p>

<h2 id="ecf3" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Brad Marchand on returning to Stanley Cup Final: &apos;We&apos;re extremely excited&apos;</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins are heading back to the Stanley Cup final for the second time in three years thanks to a sweep over the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 conference finals Friday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Adam McQuaid scored Game 4&apos;s only goal at 5:01 of the third period while netminder Tuukka Rask posted his second shutout of the series and finished with 26 saves.</p>

<p>Boston will play either the Chicago Blackhawks or Los Angeles Kings.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s very exciting. It&apos;s a feeling you can&apos;t describe,</q> Brad Marchand said. <q>We&apos;ve worked for this our whole lives and it doesn&apos;t matter that we won one a couple years back. I think it made us that much hungrier to be back here and win another one. We&apos;re extremely excited right now.</q></p>

<p>Marchand assisted on McQuaid&apos;s strike to finish with four points for the series. Overall he has 13.</p>

<p>Center David Krejci had a real life perspective on returning to the Cup finals.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s pretty cool,</q> Krejci said. <q>Yesterday I was watching TV and somebody on TV said the Bruins are going for the sweep in Game 4 to get to the Stanley Cup final for second time in three years. It was pretty cool to hear and now we&apos;re here, now we&apos;re talking about going to the final again.</q></p>

<p>Here are other team reactions:</p>

<p><strong>Left winger Milan Lucic</strong></p>

<p><q>It&apos;s awesome. Being through what we&apos;ve been through as a team over the years and even this year with everything that happened in the first round and Game 7 and just going through that and getting to this point, it&apos;s truly a great feeling. I think we definitely need to enjoy this tonight ... just enjoy it the next couple of days and then regroup, refocus, and go out there and start having fun.</q></p>

<p><strong>Coach Claude Julien</strong></p>

<p><q>What it means to us, it means a lot. We pride ourselves on our game. We work hard at it. As you saw, there was a lot of commitment in this game tonight. You look at the blocked shot by Gregory Campbell to tonight when the game was on the line. I think our guys really paid the price and did what it took to get there.</q></p>

<p><strong>Goalie Tuukka Rask</strong></p>

<p><q>That&apos;s what you dream about, right? Couldn&apos;t be better.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecf4" class="">Adam McQuaid scores only goal as Boston Bruins sweep Pittsburgh Penguins to return to Stanley Cup final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/adam_mcquaid_scores_only_goal_as_boston_bruins_sweep_pittsburgh_penguins_to_return_to_stanley_cup_fi.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-07T22:50-05:00" pubdate>June 7, 2013, 10:50 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; No one gave the Bruins a chance against the mighty offensive machine of the Pittsburgh Penguins before the start of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>

<p>But once again, the big, bad, gritty underdogs from Boston proved everybody wrong. And with the strongest of statements.</p>

<p>The Bruins needed only one goal Friday night to send the Penguins packing. Netminder Tuukka Rask did the rest.</p>

<p>Defenseman Adam McQuaid scored at 5:01 of the third period and Rask finished with 26 saves for his second shutout of the best-of-7 series to give the Bruins a 1-0 win and a sweep that sent them back to the Stanley Cup final for the second time in three years.</p>

<p>A TD Garden sellout crowd of 17,565 erupted in <q>We want the Cup</q> chants shortly after McQuaid&apos;s strike and as time expired.</p>

<p><q>I think everyone kind of counted us out,</q> winger Brad Marchand said. <q>We just wanted to make sure that everyone came in every night and was focused and did the job. We did get some lucky breaks, some lucky bounces, and other guys stepped up at the right time.</q></p>

<p>The way the series played out for the Penguins was mind boggling.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh&apos;s most dangerous snipers &mdash; Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Jarome Iginla &mdash; were held scoreless.</p>

<p>Its lethal power-play unit finished 0 for 15.</p>

<p><q>(Penalty-kill) has always been a strength of ours all year long,</q> Marchand said. <q>I think we&apos;re getting back to the basics and just making sure we got pucks out and were getting in lanes.</p>

<p><q>We knew we had a big job to do with Pittsburgh. Coming into the series, a lot of their offense was coming off their power play, and if we wanted to have a chance to beat them, we knew we had to try and limit their opportunities.</q></p>

<p>The Penguins made one last desperate attempt to tie the game with an extra attacker when netminder Tomas Vokoun (23 saves) skated to the bench with 1:34 remaining.</p>

<p>Rask was peppered with multiple shots, including a scary bid by Malkin, but he stood his ground.</p>

<p><q>Nothing is for sure until it is in the net,</q> Bruins center David Krejci said. <q>Tuukka has been playing great the whole series, the whole playoffs ... he needs the players in front of him to play great as well, and I think as a team we did that. We won it as a team.</q></p>

<p>Rask was absolutely stellar. He finished with a .985 save percentage for the series and is at .943 for the postseason with a 1.75 goals-against average.</p>

<p>Boston&apos;s only goal arose from a wise decision by Marchand.</p>

<p>Driving down the left side, he pulled up to wait for reinforcements. Then he found McQuaid hanging at the high point for a blistering slap shot that went top shelf past Vokoun.</p>

<p>Marchand admitted he was going to give it to Krejci, but at the last second saw McQuaid open.</p>

<p>With the game still scoreless midway through the second period, play got a bit chippy.</p>

<p>Penguins winger Beau Bennett landed a brutal hit on Torey Krug into the end boards in the Boston zone, cutting the rookie defenseman&apos;s mouth.</p>

<p>Krug was seen being tended to by trainer Don DelNegro on the bench afterward.</p>

<p>After driving hard to the net for a scoring bid, Penguin Matt Niskanen gave a few shoves to Marchand. The Bruins instigator retaliated with a few punches before being grabbed and wrapped up by the linesmen.</p>

<p>Both were directed to the box with matching roughing minors.</p>

<p>Krug almost answered with a quick wrister, but it was gloved by Vokoun.</p>

<p>Later in the period, Bruins right winger Tyler Seguin almost snapped his four-game goal drought with a drive, but the puck landed in the chest of the Penguins goalie.</p>

<p>Seconds after serving his roughing penalty, Marchand went back to the box for inference to give the Penguins a second shot at the power play. But the Bruins penalty-killers and Rask held them off the board.</p>

<p>The Bruins had a chance to capitalize on the man advantage at 8:27, but they didn&apos;t pressure enough.</p>

<p>They finished 0 for 13 for the series.</p>

<p>Rask was tested in the first period and came up with key stops.</p>

<p>He clung to life after gathering a loose puck in a scrum in front of the net at the 6:32 mark, then robbed Crosby a minute later to keep the game scoreless.</p>

<p>There were a few bad moments with turnovers in the neutral zone to lead to Penguins rushes downice, but the Bruins&apos; defensemen responded by poke-checking and battling along the boards to regain possession.</p>

<p>Both teams had tries on the power play but came up empty.</p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; With the Boston Bruins one win away from their second Stanley Cup final appearance in three seasons, the question is:</p>

<p>Is this Bruins team better than the one in 2011?</p>

<p>Bobby Orr thinks so.</p>

<p>The Bruins legendary blueliner said it on WEEI&apos;s Dennis and Callahan Show on Thursday morning following Boston&apos;s gutsy 2-1 double-overtime win to give it a 3-0 lead in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Game 4 &mdash; a potential clincher for the Bruins &mdash; was Friday night.</p>

<p><q>Everybody on that Bruin team, top to bottom, they’re doing what they are supposed to do to win,</q> Orr said. <q>I watched the other (series) and I can’t see anybody beating them.</q></p>

<p>And he may be right.</p>

<p>As good as the Bruins were in their unforgettable 2011 Cup run, 2013 could prove to be more epic.</p>

<p>In 2011 netminder Tim Thomas was a magician while the team defense helped bat pucks out of harms&apos; way.</p>

<p>Nathan Horton was a playoff hero, scoring three game-winners &mdash; two in overtime fashion &mdash; then became an inspiration after going down with a concussion in Game 3 of the Cup finals against Vancouver.</p>

<p>Mark Recchi was the veteran presence in the locker room. Defenseman Andrew Ference introduced the Bruins retro Starter Jacket awarded to the <q>Player of the Game.</q></p>

<p>Rookies Brad Marchand and Tyler Seguin didn&apos;t play like rookies. And David Krejci led the playoffs in scoring with 23 points.</p>

<p>In 2013 so far?</p>

<p>Tuukka Rask is a brick wall. You can argue he&apos;s played better than Thomas without the fancy highlight-reel saves.</p>

<p>Patrice Bergeron is the clutch guy with two overtime winners, plus the goal that saved the Bruins&apos; season, which tied Game 7 of the conference quarterfinals against Toronto to send it into extra time.</p>

<p>Gregory Campbell breaks his leg by blocking on a shot on the penalty-kill and finishes his shift before heading down the tunnel. He&apos;s the new inspiration.</p>

<p>Jaromir Jagr is the veteran guy making plays with Marchand and Bergeron.</p>

<p>Ference gets his hands on an army ranger jacket awarded to the <q>Player of the Game</q> sporting a spoked-B logo patch on the right sleeve to commemorate the Boston Marathon bombings.</p>

<p>Rookie Torey Krug is the puck-moving defenseman that Bruins fans wished Tomas Kaberle was half of in his short time wearing the Black and Gold.</p>

<p>And Krejci is leading the playoffs again in scoring with 21 points.</p>

<p>What is different this year is that the Bruins were 11 minutes away from easily being eliminated in the first round against the Leafs, down by three goals. But ever since that historic comeback, Boston&apos;s been riding the momentum.</p>

<p>The New York Rangers were easily dispatched in five games in the conference semis. Pittsburgh will come out an even more desperate team Friday night for Game 4.</p>

<p>Two years ago it took the Bruins seven games to rid of the Montreal Canadiens in the first round. They swept Philadelphia then needed the full seven to close out Tampa Bay in the conference finals.</p>

<p>Before this year&apos;s conference finals, no one gave the Bruins a chance against the mighty Penguins.</p>

<p>The journey is a little bit different, but the similarities are compelling.</p>

<p><strong>DAUGAVINS IN:</strong> With Campbell out for the remainder of the playoffs with a broken leg, Kaspars Daugavins returned to the lineup.</p>

<p>Daugavins played in Game 1 of the first round against Toronto and has been a healthy scratch since.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s a gritty player,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>He&apos;s strong on the puck, strong individual, he can shoot the puck. Got a lot of qualities.</q></p>

<p>Daugavins skated at left wing with Rich Peverley and Tyler Seguin in morning skate while Chris Kelly centered wings Daniel Paille and Shawn Thornton.</p>

<h2 id="ecf6" class="">Boston Bruins need to win for injured teammate Gregory Campbell</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_need_to_win_for_injured_teammate_gregory_campbell.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-06T16:49-05:00" pubdate>June 6, 2013, 4:49 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>When Gregory Campbell dove in the path of Pittsburgh&apos;s Evgeni Malkin&apos;s slap shot while on the penalty kill in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday night, the Bruins fourth-line center didn&apos;t think twice about it.</p>

<p>He did what he was suppose to do. He took away a shooting lane in the high slot and prevented the Penguins from scoring their first power-play goal of the series.</p>

<p>But the block came at a steep price as Campbell is done for the remainder of the playoffs with a broken right leg.</p>

<p>He sacrificed his body &mdash; literally &mdash; for the sake of the team as the Bruins went on to win 2-1 in double overtime to put them a game away from sweeping Pittsburgh and advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in three years.</p>

<p><q>The fact that he took that shot and he couldn&apos;t even move and he was still trying to play and get in the lane,</q> Bruins forward Brad Marchand said. <q>He did a great job and we really wanted to play for him, and it just shows his character. He&apos;s always battling. He&apos;s always doing whatever he has to do and he&apos;s been huge for us this playoffs so far.</q></p>


<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h15m87WsCHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>The play was agonizing to watch, but ended inspirational. It was obvious from the expression on Campbell&apos;s face that something was seriously wrong.</p>

<p>He could have just laid on the ice or crawled straight to the bench. But he didn&apos;t.</p>

<p>Losing Campbell is a huge blow. He&apos;s one of the team&apos;s best penalty killers and he&apos;s contributed key goals with linemates Daniel Paille and Shawn Thornton.</p>

<p>The Bruins need to rally around Campbell like they did for Nathan Horton in 2011 when he went down with a concussion in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup final against Vancouver.</p>

<p>They need to win it for him.</p>

<p>They owe him big time.</p>

<p>Campbell&apos;s heroics could have saved the Bruins the series. Momentum was slowly shifting in Pittsburgh&apos;s direction. Chris Kunitz gave the Penguins life when he tied it at 8:51 of the second period. And they were threatening to strike again.</p>

<p>But some how, some way, Pittsburgh couldn&apos;t answer. It was baffling.</p>

<p>Netminder Tuukka Rask stopped everything thrown at him. It&apos;s hard to believe he&apos;s only been touched for two goals.</p>

<p>Rask is in the zone and his 53-save performance was easily his best yet. He stopped 10 shots alone from Malkin and never looked panicked.</p>

<p><q>We&apos;re very excited with the way he&apos;s playing,</q> Marchand said. <q>He&apos;s done a great job and he definitely kept us in it. He won it (Wednesday) and we&apos;re going to need him more.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecf7" class="">Report: Boston Bruins&apos; Gregory Campbell done for playoffs with broken leg</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; Boston Bruins center Gregory Campbell is done for the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>According to ESPNBoston.com&apos;s Joe McDonald citing a team source, Campbell suffered a broken right leg in the Bruins&apos; 2-1 overtime thriller in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Campbell blocked a slap shot by Penguins center Evgeni Malkin while Pittsburgh was on the power play in the second period. Campbell crumbled to the ice in pain, but managed to lift himself up and finish out his shift without being a liability.</p>

<p>The sellout crowd of 17,565 chanted <q>Camp-bell, Camp-bell</q> as he skated off on his own power and headed straight down the tunnel.</p>

<p>The Penguins finished the game going 0 for 6 on the man advantage and are now 0 for 12 in the series.</p>

<p><q>(Malkin) had a lane and (Campbell) sacrificed his body,</q> Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask said. <q>It was a great thing, just a bad thing he got hurt. He blocks a lot of shots, he took one for the team there and we really wanted to win this for him.</q></p>

<p>It was a gutsy play by the fourth-line center and his team certainly appreciated it despite him being injured.</p>

<p><q>That&apos;s a thankless job right there. (Gregory Campbell) does that,</q> Bruins center Chris Kelly said. <q>He&apos;s been doing it his whole career and I think the fact that he stayed up, finished his shift, and made it to the bench speaks volumes about how strong he is and willingness to battle.</q></p>

<p>Campbell is a huge loss to the Bruins&apos; penalty-kill unit and his absence will be a factor for the remainder of the series.</p>

<p>Game 4 is Friday night at TD Garden as the Penguins hope to force a Game 5, which would be played on Sunday back at CONSOL Energy Center in Pittsburgh.</p>

<h2 id="ecf8" class="">Patrice Bergeron wins it in double overtime as the Boston Bruins take 3-0 series lead over Pittsburgh Penguins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/patrice_bergeron_wins_it_in_double_overtime_as_the_boston_bruins_take_3-0_series_lead_over_pittsburg.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-06T00:42-05:00" pubdate>June 6, 2013, 12:42 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; It wasn&apos;t as easy as the first two games, but the Boston Bruins were able to come out with the pivotal win in Game 3.</p>

<p>With 4:41 remaining of the second overtime period, Brad Marchand found Patrice Bergeron in front as he buried the puck past Penguins netminder Tomas Vokoun to give the Bruins a 2-1 win and 3-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Bergeron and Marchand were literally jumping for joy with the sellout crowd of 17,565 as the game ended minutes after midnight.</p>

<p><q>Bergy, he does everything right,</q> Marchand said. <q>And it&apos;s little things that make him such a great player.</q></p>

<p>The goal wouldn&apos;t have been possible if not for the strong board work by Jaromir Jagr who battled for puck possession after losing it.</p>

<p><q>(Jagr) got the puck and then just a simple play to the net and Patrice had, again, a great stick,</q> Chara said. <q>He seemed to be the man to look for at times.</q></p>

<p>The game started out shaky for the Penguins back in the first period as they gave up an atrocious goal to David Krejci at 1:42.</p>

<p>Krejci camped himself behind the Penguins&apos; net untouched by Kris Letang and Matt Niskanen, skated out to the left faceoff circle and easily wristed a shot past Vokoun (38 saves).</p>

<p>His shot deflected off Niskanen&apos;s stick with Bruins left wing Milan Lucic serving as a screen.</p>

<p>But Pittsburgh calmed down immensely and were able to answer in the second period off the stick of Chris Kunitz at 8:51 after an array of shot on the power play.</p>

<p>Both teams sported dismal power-play units as the Bruins finished 0 for 5 while the Penguins were 0 for 6.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh who entered the series with a 28.3 percent success rate is 0 for 12 through three games.</p>

<p>One area the Penguins dominated in though was the faceoff circle, winning 57 percent of their draws while the Bruins finished at 43 percent.</p>

<p>Bergeron who is normally strong on draw only won 13 of 35 attempts.</p>

<p><q>We found a way I guess,</q> Bergeron said. <q>That&apos;s the only way you&apos;ve got to look at it. It wasn&apos;t necessarily out best effort in the first 60 (minutes). But I thought we regrouped well in overtime and we had some really good chances in the first overtime and we kept battling.</q></p>

<p>There were several opportunities for both teams to end it in the first overtime period, but Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask (53 saves) and Vokoun were solid.</p>

<p>The third period was the worst for Boston as it managed just four shots on goal.</p></p>

<p>The Bruins had three tries to capitalize on the man-advantage in the period, but failed to keep possession of the puck in the attacking zone.</p>

<p>The Bruins found themselves killing off back-to-back penalties on Krejci (roughing) and Adam McQuaid (boarding) in the first 1:44 of the second period, but managed to preserve the 1-0 lead.</p>

<p>Rask made numerous key stops while the penalty-killers cleared out lose rebounds down to the other end.</p>

<p>That moment proved to be the most crucial.</p>

<p>But it was only a matter of time the Penguins would find the back of the net.</p>

<p>Paul Martin drove down the right side and fed Kunitz a perfect cross-ice, tape-to-tape pass and snapped the puck past Rask at 8:51.</p>

<p>The play started off a clean faceoff win by Penguins center Sidney Crosby against Bergeron.</p>

<p>The Bruins penalty-killers remained busy throughout the period and took a real beating &mdash; literally.</p>

<p>Bruins center Gregory Campbell showed true grit by remaining on the ice for over a minute after taking a shot from Evgeni Malkin off his right leg. Campbell was slow to his feet, hobbled around, but still used his stick to poke the puck away and mess the Penguins&apos; rhyme.</p>

<p>Campbell didn&apos;t depart for the bench until the penalty expired as the crowd erupted in <q>Camp-bell</q> chants.</p>

<p>He didn&apos;t return to the game.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien said more will be be known on Campbell&apos;s status Thursday.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s a man that he does whatever the team needs and he&apos;s willing to sacrifice his body,</q> Chara said.</p>

<h2 id="ecf9" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton outproducing Pittsburgh Penguins&apos; top line</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_milan_lucic_david_krejci_and_nathan_horton_better_so_far_over_pittsburgh_penguins_top.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-05T17:13-05:00" pubdate>June 5, 2013, 5:13 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The storyline heading into the Eastern Conference finals last week was the power of the Pittsburgh offense.</p>

<p>But heading into Game 3 Wednesday at TD Garden with Boston up 2-0 in the series, the focus is how the Bruins&apos; top line has outperformed the Penguins.</p>

<p>Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton are putting up numbers that most believed Chris Kunitz, Sidney Crosby and Pascal Dupuis would compile.</p>

<p>The Bruins trio is responsible for 10 of their team&apos;s 23 points and accounted for all three goals in Game 1 as the Bruins blanked the Penguins for the first time in 16 months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Penguins threesome has contributed nothing but zeros across the scoresheet and is a combined minus-8.</p>

<p>The only players who have put up points are third-liners Brandon Sutter and Matt Cooke and defenseman Paul Martin. Sutter scored Pittsburgh&apos;s first goal of the series with 30 seconds remaining of the opening period of Game 2.</p>

<p>Krejci, one of the most underrated players in the NHL, was asked after scoring twice in Game 1 whether he should be in the same class with Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The soft-spoken Czech politely said no.</p>

<p>However, his numbers say otherwise.</p>

<p>Krejci is leading the league with 20 playoff points and is tied for first with Chicago Blackhawks winger Patrick Sharp with eight goals.</p>

<p>He is three points shy of his 2011 playoff total, when he also led the league as the Bruins captured the Stanley Cup over the Vancouver Canucks in seven games.</p>

<p>Horton has also elevated his game in the postseason as he tops the league with a plus-19 in 14 games. In 35 career playoff games, all with Boston, Horton is a whopping plus-30.</p>

<p>His linemates round out the top three in playoff plus/minus, both at plus-12.</p>

<p><strong>KRUG CONTROL:</strong> Before the start of the conference finals, Bruins rookie defenseman Torey Krug said it was important to not alter his game.</p>

<p>He hasn&apos;t scored yet, but has been heavily involved in key plays.</p>

<p>Krug assisted on Horton&apos;s goal seconds after a power-play opportunity expired, which gave Boston a 2-0 lead in the first period of Game 2.</p>

<p>Krug has yet to be on the ice for an opposing goal since making his playoff debut in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Rangers. In seven games, he is a plus-4.</p>

<p><strong>OK WITH VISORS:</strong> The NHL announced Tuesday that starting next season, it could become mandatory for all players entering the league to wear a protective visor, pending the approval of the Board of Governors.</p>

<p>The Competition Committee, which includes five players from the NHL Players&apos; Association, five league executives, a referee and members of the league&apos;s hockey operations department, all agreed to the change.</p>

<p>Current NHL players will still have still the option not to wear a visor.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien agreed with the new proposal.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;m one of those guys that when a young player comes up playing minor hockey with a visor and he&apos;s used to it, why take it off?</q> he said. <q>I know there&apos;s been some accidents with a visor, but there&apos;s been more incidents saved by the visor.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecf10" class="">Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand making life miserable for Pittsburgh Penguins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_forward_brad_marchand_making_life_miserable_for_pittsburgh_penguins.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-04T16:38-05:00" pubdate>June 4, 2013, 4:38 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Boston Bruins left wing Brad Marchand has been an absolute pain in Pittsburgh&apos;s backside.</p>

<p>Not only is the <q>Little Ball of Hate</q> getting under the Penguins&apos; skin, he&apos;s also finding the back of the net. And when Marchand can be both pest and scoring threat, it&apos;s bad news for opponents.</p>

<p>Marchand was responsible for two key goals in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals Monday night at CONSOL Energy Center in Pittsburgh, each ripped past a different goalie.</p>

<p>One gave Boston a 1-0 lead 28 seconds in, while the other erased any momentum that may have shifted Pittsburgh&apos;s way.</p>

<p>When Brandon Sutter scored the Penguins&apos; first goal of the series with 34 seconds remaining in the opening period, Marchand responded just 25 seconds later to give the Bruins a 4-1 lead at intermission.</p>

<p>Making that dagger even more sweet was the fact it came after a shoving match with Matt Cooke along the boards in the Boston zone.</p>

<p>It was the first shot Marc-Andre Fleury saw after he replaced starter Tomas Vokoun when David Krejci put the Bruins up 3-0 at 16:31.</p>

<p>Marchand&apos;s goal proved bigger than Sutter&apos;s. Way bigger.</p>

<p>It killed off any hope the Penguins had of coming back as the Bruins went on to win 6-1.</p>

<p>That&apos;s the other annoying side of Marchand and why he&apos;s so valuable to his team. It might not be too crazy to say he&apos;s gotten inside some Penguins&apos; heads, all starting in Game 1.</p>

<p>With 30 seconds left in the second period Saturday, Marchand hit James Neal in front of the Pittsburgh bench, causing the Penguins winger to crash into the boards.</p>

<p>He received a minor penalty to give the Penguins their fourth power play, but nothing more.</p>

<p>Earlier in the period, Cooke received a major penalty and game misconduct for checking Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid in the numbers. McQuaid braced for the hit, then fell face first onto the ice, clearly in pain. Luckily for Cooke, McQuaid wasn&apos;t injured.</p>

<p>The Penguins were irked Marchand didn&apos;t receive the same fate as Cooke, and once the period ended, captain Sidney Crosby started a ruckus by elbowing Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask near the chest while skating off the ice.</p>

<p>Bruins counterpart Zdeno Chara got in Crosby&apos;s face while the mild-tempered Patrice Bergeron and Evgeni Malkin tossed their gloves and threw fists.</p>

<p>It appears the Penguins have yet to calm down from this and play their game. They looked terrible in Game 2, and not just offensively. Their defense was a complete no-show, the Bruins jumping all over their every mistake.</p>

<p>The Penguins turned the puck over 12 times &mdash; four more than in Game 1. The Bruins did it twice.</p>

<p>In a way, it&apos;s hard not to feel for Vokoun. His team didn&apos;t help him out whatsoever. The goals allowed to Marchand, Nathan Horton and Krejci weren&apos;t completely his fault, but coach Dan Bylsma didn&apos;t really have any choice.</p>

<p>Bylsma couldn&apos;t switch out defenseman Kris Letang, who was on the ice for all three goals and finished minus-3. He could have benched him, but who in their right mind would bench a Norris Trophy finalist?</p>

<h2 id="ecf11" class="">Pittsburgh Penguins&apos; Sidney Crosby needs to act like a captain, stay composed, against Boston Bruins for Game 2</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/pittsburgh_penguins_sidney_crosby_needs_to_act_like_a_captain_stay_composed_against_boston_bruins_fo.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-03T10:00-05:00" pubdate>June 3, 2013, 10:00 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins picked the wrong team to mess with.</p>

<p>If the Penguins honestly think they can beat the Boston Bruins by acting like tough guys, they are in for a very rude awakening.</p>

<p>Heading into the Eastern Conference finals, it was known that these two teams didn&apos;t like each other, but no one expected tempers to flare up after only two periods of play in Game 1 Saturday night at the CONSOL Energy Center.</p>

<p>Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was frustrated that he couldn&apos;t find the back of net and decided to let Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask know about it with an elbow near his Spoked-B on his sweater while skating off.</p>

<p>This set off Bruins captain Zdeno Chara as he got in Crosby&apos;s face. Crosby shoved Chara then cowardly hid behind the referee.</p>

<p>While that was happening the normally composed Patrice Bergeron and counterpart Evgeni Malkin angrily whipped their gloves off and threw punches.</p>

<p><q>I guess it&apos;s just part of the playoffs,</q> Bergeron told The Boston Globe Sunday following practice. <q>We know that the emotions are high, the intensity&apos;s high, games are big so I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m really surprised but at the same time it just happened.</q></p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DmhQsf7EYik" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>That was a big mistake on the Penguins&apos; part who went on to be shut out for the first time in 16 months, losing 3-0.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t the Penguins know not to poke the bear?</p>

<p>The Bruins are thus far, the most physical team the Penguins have faced during their playoff run. And they know they need to be equally as physical to stand a chance against Boston.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh nearly finished with double of the amount of hits over Boston in Game 1, 34-19, but still lost.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>They returned to their same uncontrollable antics, which cost them last season in the first round against the Philadelphia Flyers where they lost the best-of-7 series in six games.</p>

<p><q>Sid the Kid</q> needs to stop acting like a kid. He&apos;s one of the most talented players in the game and there&apos;s no need for him to pull cheap shots like he did on Rask then whine about it afterwards.</p>

<p>A big reason for the boil over was because the Penguins were infuriated that Brad Marchand didn&apos;t suffer a more severe penalty for his hit on James Neal in front of the team&apos;s bench with 30 seconds left in the second period.</p>

<p>Marchand received a minor for boarding to give Pittsburgh its fourth power-play opportunity.</p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LI2l-MULEvE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>Penguins wing Matt Cooke was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct earlier in the period after hitting Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid from behind into the end boards.</p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcFbx9PhD-E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>&ldquo;They&apos;re letting a lot go out there and the more it gets like that, the more it&apos;s going to escalate,&rdquo; Crosby said to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. &ldquo;You can only control and channel that stuff so much. You keep letting guys do that stuff, you&apos;re just going to push the envelope. That&apos;s something we obviously want to stay away from, but it&apos;s kind of a natural thing when it gets like that. It was just hard to gauge.</p>

<p><q>Interference calls where you barely catch a guy, and then you&apos;re allowing punches to the head. Are we going to play or are we going to call those little things once in a while? It&apos;s hard to get a temperature on the game when that stuff is going on. Then you let a few of those go and everything starts getting out of hand. We&apos;ve just got to focus on playing.</q></p>

<p>Marchand&apos;s hit wasn&apos;t nearly as nasty as the one Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Dion Phaneuf pulled on Daniel Paille in Game 2 of the first round. Phaneuf leaned his shoulder into Paille&apos;s head and no penalty was called.</p>

<p>In the third period, Crosby slashed Bruins winger Tyler Seguin and acted as if he did nothing wrong while being directed to the penalty box. Seguin&apos;s expression was priceless as his face read: <q>give me a break.</q></p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to believe Crosby is the same guy who was heavily involved in talks to help end the lockout.</p>

<p>He can act out all he likes. The Bruins should root for it. Because if the Penguins can&apos;t keep their composure the Bruins will jump all over them and capitalize.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/06/boston_bruins_top_line_at_its_best_in_game_1_win_over_pittsburgh_penguins.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-06-03T6:00-05:00" pubdate>June 3, 2013, 6:00 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>There were a lot of keys going the Boston Bruins&apos; way in their 3-0 Game 1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins of the Eastern Conference final Saturday at the CONSOL Energy Center.</p>

<p>And the Bruins need to continue to maintain them in order to have a shot in the series heading into Game 2 Monday night.</p>

<p>Boston registered only one giveaway &mdash; by center David Krejci who was able to retrieve the puck back in the same play &mdash; to Pittsburgh&apos;s eight.</p>

<p>Netminder Tuukka Rask (29 saves) shut out the Penguins for the first time in 16 months (Feb. 1, 2012) in his best postseason performance with the help from a few lucky bounces and dinged posts.</p>

<p>He was helped out by a solid outing by the Bruins&apos; defensive corps who cleared the puck out of danger to frustrate Penguins snipers all night long.</p>

<p>The penalty-kill, like Pittsburgh&apos;s, was a perfect 4-for-4.
But most of all, the top line led by Krejci, Nathan Horton and Milan Lucic answered the call of duty and provided all of the team&apos;s offense.</p>

<p>Krejci scored for the first time since he posted his second career playoff hat trick in Game 4 of the first round against Toronto and finished with two.</p>

<p>Horton assisted on both of Krejci&apos;s goals and netted the third with help from Lucic. Horton is quietly on a three-game point-streak compiling two goals and four assists during the stretch. He continues to blow everyone away in plus/minus rating with a league leading +17, which is six points ahead of his linemates who rank second and third, respectively.</p>

<p>But it&apos;s not just about the points. Horton skated a strong game and did a lot of little things to help produce and limit mistakes. He was superb along the boards, winning puck battles to keep possession in Pittsburgh&apos;s zone.</p>

<p>Lucic was constantly leading rushes down the ice and creating chances. He won his only face-off attempt. It&apos;s those small details that help win games.</p>

<p>Game 1 was a perfect example of Boston Bruins hockey at its best. But the team knows there&apos;s always room for improvement.</p>

<p><q>At the beginning I don&apos;t think we were at our sharpest,</q> Rask told The Boston Herald. <q>It was more of what we were seeing in the regular season at times &mdash; kind of sloppy, our heads not in the game. After 10 minutes, we were good.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecf13" class="">Pittsburgh Penguins&apos; Jarome Iginla, Matt Cooke, should serve as motivation for Boston Bruins</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/pittsburgh_penguins_jarome_iginla_matt_cooke_should_serve_as_motivation_for_boston_bruins.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-31T17:01-05:00" pubdate>May 31, 2013, 5:01 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>There&apos;s no doubt that there is plenty of bad blood between the Boston Bruins and the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>

<p>And this should make the Eastern Conference finals worth the long wait as the best-of-7 series kicks off Saturday night at the CONSOL Energy Center in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>There are way too many good story lines and if the Bruins are smart, they&apos;ll feed off them.</p>

<p>Even though they continue to deny it, the Bruins should be irked that Jarome Iginla picked the Penguins over them at the NHL trade deadline. That&apos;s what happened no matter how much Iginla played it different. He chose to waive his no-trade clause to go to Pittsburgh, that&apos;s it.</p>

<p>Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said Calgary Flames counterpart Jay Feaster told him at noon Wednesday one week before the deadline that he had <q>won the Jarome Iginla sweepstakes.</q></p>

<p>But roughly after midnight, Chiarelli and Bruins fans were blindsided when the Penguins&apos; official Twitter account tweeted out of nowhere that they acquired Iginla.</p>

<p>Iginla believed his chances of winning a Stanley Cup were greater playing with two of the world&apos;s best players in Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.</p>

<p>Now Boston has a chance to stick it to him and Pens GM Ray Shero who not only gave up peanuts for the Calgary Flames star, but falls in the same category as Iginla.</p>

<p>Seven years ago it appeared imminent that Shero would fill Boston&apos;s vacant GM seat after the club fired Mike O&apos;Connell. But Shero, who was the assistant GM of the Nashville Predators, broke off talks with Boston and instead picked Pittsburgh after club president Ken Sawyer owner Mario Lemieux gave him better compensation and a wider range of authority.</p>

<p>A day later, Chiarelli signed with the Bruins.</p>

<p>Why else should Shero be perceived as a villain in Boston?</p>

<p>He signed Matt Cooke, of the dirtiest players in the game, as a free agent in 2008. Two years later Cooke targeted Marc Savard&apos;s head with a blindside elbow. Cooke wasn&apos;t suspended and the Bruins center hasn&apos;t been the same since.</p>

<p>Savard missed the last 18 games of the regular season with his fourth career concussion and didn&apos;t return until the Eastern Conference semifinals against Philadelphia. He scored the game-winner in overtime of Game 1, but wasn&apos;t a factor for the rest of the series as the Bruins went on to blow a 3-0 series lead.</p>

<p>Then on Jan. 22, 2011 Savard absorbed a clean hit from Colorado Avalanche defenseman Matt Hunwick and was diagnosed with his fifth head injury.</p>

<p>Savard announced his shut down for the remainder of the season at a press conference at TD Garden on Feb. 7 and hasn&apos;t returned to the ice since. To this day, he remains on Boston&apos;s long-term injured reserve.</p>

<p>It&apos;s safe to say that Cooke helped end Savard&apos;s NHL career. He still deals with post-concussion symptoms on a daily basis as he revealed to reporters during his last public appearance in Boston in January 2012 when the Bruins hosted the New York Rangers.</p>

<p>The Bruins are the clear underdogs of this series. The Penguins have won the last eight straight playoff games dating back to Game 4 of the 1991 Prince of Wales Conference Finals where they rallied from an 0-2 series deficit to win four games to two.</p>

In the 1992 conference finals, the Penguins swept.</p>

<h2 id="ecf14" class="">Underdog Boston Bruins can beat powerhouse Pittsburgh Penguins in Eastern Conference final</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/underdog_boston_bruins_can_beat_powerhouse_pittsburgh_penguins_in_eastern_conference_final.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-30T15:56-05:00" pubdate>May 30, 2013, 3:56 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>I&apos;m just going to come out and say it.</p>

<p>The Boston Bruins have a legitimate shot at beating the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference final.</p>

<p>This may sound crazy to any Penguins fan. Even quite laughable. But the truth of the matter is, the Bruins have shown us, past and present, they are capable of pulling off big surprises. And this series is no different.</p>

<p>The Bruins shocked the world when they overcame an 0-2 series deficit on to capture the Stanley Cup in seven games over the heavily favored Vancouver Canucks in 2011.</p>

<p>Everyone thought the Canucks would easily sweep led by the sniping Sedin brothers, Daniel and Henrik, and Vezina Trophy finalist backstop Roberto Luongo. But after winger Nathan Horton was concussed by Aaron Rome in Game 3 at TD Garden, the Big, Bad, Bruins woke up and everything changed.</p>

<p>The Vancouver series was the last time the Bruins were tagged with the underdog role. And they embraced it well. Now they are faced with it again. Only this time there&apos;s a lot more to deal with.</p>

<p>Boston has to figure out a way to shut down Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Jarome Iginla, Pascal Dupuis, Chris Kunitz, James Neal, and Norris Trophy finalist Kris Letang.</p>

<p>On paper, it looks absurd. But people are forgetting the Bruins have a solid defensive core. And even more so after dispatching the Rangers in the conference semis.</p>

<p>Having defenseman Dennis Seidenberg back is huge. He will likely return with Zdeno Chara as the top shutdown unit. The kids are riding high on confidence led by Torey Krug and Matt Bartkowski. And Johnny Boychuk hasn&apos;t just been a playoff warrior. He&apos;s scoring goals &mdash; something he only did once during the regular season in the opener back in January.</p>

<p>When all else fails, Boston is equipped with a netminder who has continued to prove his toughest critics wrong. The Penguins will be Tuukka Rask&apos;s toughest challenge yet, but he is up for it.</p>

<p>Rask is by no means <q>a clown act</q> dubbed by controversial Pittsburgh sports radio host Mark Madden who was a guest on Gresh and Zolak on 98.5 The Sports Hub Wednesday.</p>

<p>No, he is not Tim Thomas, so just stop with the comparisons.</p>

<p>Rask&apos;s style is different from Thomas&apos;. Rask&apos;s body type (6-foot-3 inches, 185-pounds) is different from Thomas&apos; (5-11, 201 lbs). Rask was traded to Boston from Toronto in 2006 in exchange for Andrew Raycroft, to be the franchise goalie of the future.</p>

<p>Thomas was lucky the Bruins gave him a shot after playing for years in Europe.</p>

<p>The week long hype over Boston and Pittsburgh will be worth it. It should be a heck of a series with a lot of trash talk.</p>

<p>But that&apos;s a good thing for the Bruins. As long as Milan Lucic keeps his mouth shut about comparing the Penguins to the NBA&apos;s Miami Heat whether he&apos;s right or not.</p>

<h2 id="ecf15" class="">Keys to the Boston Bruins-Pittsburgh Penguins conference final series: special teams, goaltending</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/keys_to_the_boston_bruins-pittsburgh_penguins_conference_final_series_special_teams_goalies.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-30T14:04-05:00" pubdate>May 30, 2013, 2:04 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The last time the Bruins and Penguins faced each other in the playoffs was in the 1992 Prince of Wales Conference Finals. Pittsburgh swept the B&apos;s in four games en route to capture the Stanley Cup sweeping the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>

<p>Boston is 9-10 lifetime against Pittsburgh in postseason play with two series wins.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh won all three meetings in the regular season &mdash; all by a goal.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of both teams:</p>

<strong>FORWARDS</strong>

<p><b>Pittsburgh:</b> The Penguins&apos; top line of Chris Kunitz, Sidney Crosby and Pascal Dupuis isn&apos;t the only threat. Their second line is just as deadly with James Neal, Evgeni Malkin and Jarome Iginla. Malkin leads all forwards with 16 points (4 goals, 12 assists). The six of them combined total 63 points through the first two rounds of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Crosby, who is tied with Dupuis as the playoff leader with seven goals, posted a hat trick in Game 2 of the conference semis vs. Ottawa and finished with six points in the series.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Boston&apos;s fourth line of Daniel Paille, Gregory Campbell and Shawn Thornton was the difference-maker in the conference semis against New York. Paille netted the game-winner in Game 3 while Campbell netted the last two goals in Game 5 to close out the Rangers. The top line of Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton was still pivotal. The trio combined for 10 points. Lucic was quiet on the scoresheet only scoring in Game 2, but his physical presence was heavily relied upon and will be key in this series.</p>

<strong>DEFENSEMEN</strong>

<p><b>Pittsburgh:</b> There&apos;s a reason why Kris Letang was named a Norris Trophy finalist. The puck-moving defenseman is tied with Malkin with 16 points (3 goals, 13 assists) and tops the league with nine power-play points, which includes seven assists. He also averages 27 minutes of ice time. Other guys to watch are Paul Martin (26:31) and Brooks Orpik (24:41) who also log big minutes.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Zdeno Chara and the rest of the Bruins&apos; defensive corps will be in for a challenge trying to shut down Crosby and company. The good news is Dennis Seidenberg is healthy again while Wade Redden and Andrew Ference could be right behind in their recoveries. The rookies stepped up tremendously with Torey Krug leading the charge with four goals and an assist. On an interesting note, 15 of Boston&apos;s 45 points have come from its blueline.</p>

<strong>SPECIAL TEAMS</strong>

<p><b>Pittsburgh:</b> The Penguins boast the deadliest power play in the playoffs. Pittsburgh has a 28.3 percentage success rate with Letang, Malkin and Crosby ranked as the top three in assists. Five Penguins have two power-play goals or more with Kunitz leading the way with three. On the penalty-kill, Pittsburgh is third-best in the league at 89.7% with two shorthanded goals. It&apos;s allowed three shorthanded goals.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Boston fared much better on the power play in the conference semis with New York. Rookie defenseman Torey Krug had three man-advantage strikes. Nathan Horton tallied one in Game 4 and is second on the club with two in the playoffs. The Bruins rank fifth with a 21.9% success-rate (7-for-32) with one shorthanded goal allowed. Boston is eighth on the penalty-kill at 81.1% scoring one shorthanded goal.</p>

<strong>GOALIES</strong>

<p><b>Pittsburgh:</b> Since taking over the No. 1 job over Marc-Andre Fleury, Tomas Vokoun has shined. He is 6-1 with a 1.85 goals-against average, .941 save percentage and one shutout. He appeared in two games against Boston during the regular season and won both.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Tuukka Rask continued his solid play from the first-round and stymied Rick Nash and the New York Rangers. He faces his toughest test yet with a fierce Penguins&apos; lineup, which beat him twice during the regular season. In 12 playoff starts, Rask is 8-4 with a 2.22 GAA and .928 save percentage.</p>

<strong>PREDICTION:</strong> Bruins in 7.

<h2 id="ecf16" class="">The legend of Torey Krug continues as Boston Bruins prepare for Pittsburgh Penguins in conference finals</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/the_legend_of_torey_krug_continues_as_boston_bruins_prepare_for_pittsburgh_penguins_in_conference_fi.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-29T20:55" pubdate>May 29, 2013, 8:55 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>WILMINGTON &mdash; The obsession with Boston Bruins rookie defenseman Torey Krug is in full bloom.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the 22-year-old was just another face in the crowd.</p>

<p>But after his historic offensive explosion in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Rangers, everyone is not only talking about the Bruins&apos; No. 5 ranked prospect as listed in The Hockey News&apos; Future Watch, but they are rushing out to buy his No. 47 sweater.</p>

<p><q>I think I&apos;m so small that people really don&apos;t think I can be a hockey player out on the street,</q> the 5-foot-9 inch, 180-pound listed Krug smiled. <q>A little bit here and there (on being recognized), but I just tried to stay focused.</q></p>

<p>A fresh shipment of Krug No. 47 T-shirts were in stock as of Wednesday night at Dick&apos;s Sporting Goods in West Springfield. As to how long they&apos;ll hang around for is anyone&apos;s guess.</p>

<p>Krug scored in consecutive games in his playoff debut becoming the fourth Bruin in club history to do so.</p>

<p>The last player to do it was Tyler Seguin who netted three goals and three assisst in his first two playoff games in the 2011 conference finals against Tampa Bay.</p>

<p>Krug finished the series with four goals &mdash; with three coming on the power play &mdash; and an assist as the Bruins ousted the Rangers in five games.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no doubt that Krug is playing with a lot of confidence And that&apos;s great news for the Bruins who hope he can carry it over into the conference finals with the Pittsburgh Penguins, which starts Saturday night in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>With all of this attention drawn to him, Krug is staying humble. He keeps reiterating how happy and fortunate he is to be with a team who has a legitimate shot at winning the Stanley Cup for the second time in three years.</p>

<p><q>I think you always have to take a step back and kind of understand what&apos;s going on,</q> Krug said. <q>It&apos;s been an unbelievable experience and I&apos;m surrounded by great people to make the experience even better.</q></p>

<p>As for facing Pittsburgh, Krug wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;m very excited,</q> Krug said. <q>If you want to win the Stanley Cup, it&apos;s only fitting that you have to go through these guys. It&apos;s a great task for us. We&apos;re excited for the opportunity and we&apos;re ready to go.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecf17" class="">Boston Bruins have to find way to shut down Pittsburgh Penguins&apos; deadly power-play attack</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_have_to_find_way_to_shut_down_pittsburgh_penguins_deadly_power-play_attack.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-29T14:45-05:00" pubdate>May 29, 2013, 2:45 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>WILMINGTON &mdash; The Pittsburgh Penguins can certainly score goals.</p>

<p>Whether it&apos;s 5-on-5, on the power-play, or penalty-kill, the Penguins boast many threats who can find the back of the net.</p>

<p>The Boston Bruins are very well aware of this and are ready to put up a fight in the Eastern Conference finals, which kicks off Saturday night at the CONSOL Energy Center in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p><q>These guys win games by three-, four-, five-goal (decisions),</q> Bruins left wing Brad Marchand said following practice at Ristuccia Arena Wednesday. <q>If we&apos;re going to have any opportunity to compete with them, we have to find a way to score goals.</q></p>

<p>The Penguins deposited 22 pucks in net against Ottawa in five games of the conference semis, which included seven- and six-goal outputs.</p>

<p>They were held to one goal once, coming in a 2-1 overtime defeat in Game 3, their only blemish of the series.</p>

<p>It was the only time they&apos;ve scored once through 11 playoff games.</p>

<p>The Bruins fared well on the scoresheet against a shot-blocking Rangers squad in their conference semis series. But the Penguins are a whole different force to reckon with.</p>

<p>There are a lot of positives Boston can take away with them from that series. And one of them is its rejuvenated power-play unit featuring rookie defenseman Torey Krug.</p>

<p>Three of Krug&apos;s four goals came on the power play.</p>

<p>Right wing Nathan Horton had the other as Boston finished 4-for-12 in the series. Boston is 7-for-32 (21.9 percent) on the man-advantage overall in the playoffs.</p>

<p><q>You really need your special teams to be good in playoffs,</q> Marchand said. <q>Guys are doing a good job of stepping up and scoring goals at the right time.</q></p>

<p>What makes the Penguins scary is their insane power play numbers. Pittsburgh tops the league with a 28.3% success rate (13-for-46). It&apos;s drawn the third-most penalties behind San Jose (50) and Detroit (47).</p>

<p>Defenseman Kris Letang and forwards Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby lead the playoffs with seven, six, and five power-play assists, respectively. Five Penguins have two power-play goals or more with Chris Kunitz leading the way with three.</p>

<p><q>I think it&apos;s one of the keys going in the series,</q> Krug said. <q>We have to be as disciplined as possible to keep them off the man-advantage. I think it&apos;s just going to be important to keep playing the same way we are. If we change our game, they&apos;re going to be able to capitalize on that.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins penalty-killers were near perfect against the Rangers going 14-for-16. This included an 0-for-12 drought until Dan Boyle connected for the team&apos;s first extra-man strike in the third period of Game 4.</p>

<p><q>I think the biggest is to try and take time and space away (from Pittsburgh),</q> Marchand said. <q>If you give those guys time to make plays, they&apos;re going to make them.</q></p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> All Bruins players was accounted for at practice. Defensemen Andrew Ference skated for the second consecutive day since suffering a lower-body injury in the first-round series with Toronto ... There were no lineup changes except for a minor tweak with the defensive pairings. Zdeno Chara and Johnny Boychuk skated together and Matt Bartkowski was paired with Dennis Seidenberg for select drills. Krug and Adam McQuaid was the third defensive pair.</p>

<h2 id="ecf19" class="">Boston Bruins need to break Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Tomas Vokoun</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_needs_to_break_pittsburgh_penguins_goalie_tomas_vokoun.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-28T16:10-05:00" pubdate>May 28, 2013, 4:10 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Boston Bruins have a history of breaking netminders in the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>They embarrassed Brian Boucher and Sergei Bobrovsky in 2011 as the Bruins went on to sweep the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>

<p>In the Stanley Cup final, the Bruins showed how fragile Vancouver Canucks&apos; Roberto Luongo was when playing in front of an intimidating and boisterous TD Garden crowd. And in the end, Tim Thomas was better in the deciding Game 7 as Boston brought home the Cup for the first time in 39 years.</p>

<p>Most recently, the Bruins figured out Vezina Trophy finalist Henrik Lundqvist as they diposed of the New York Rangers in five games of the conference semis.</p>

<p>Heading into the conference finals, the Bruins know that the Pittsburgh Penguins will be their toughest challenge yet.</p>

<p>The Penguins boast a load of snipers and power forwards in Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, James Neal, Pascal Dupuis, and Jarome Iginla and a dangerous puck-moving defenseman and Norris Trophy finalist, Kris Letang.</p>

<p>But one position the will likely become a key factor in the series is goaltending.</p>

<p>Enter Tomas Vokoun.</p>

<p>Vokoun was sent to Pittsburgh via trade from the Washington Capitals last summer in exchange for a seventh-round draft pick.</p>

<p>He was immediately signed to two-year, $4 million deal to serve as a backup to Marc-Andre Fleury.</p>

<p>Vokoun has served well in that role, sporting a 13-4 record, 2.45 goals-against average, and .919 save percentage during the regular season. In his last 11 starts, he went 10-1, which included a no-decision against Montreal.</p>

<p>Now he is on an absolute roll in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Vokoun started over Fleury in Game 5 of the first-round against the New York Islanders after the No. 1 netminder allowed 14 goals in his last three starts after posting a shutout in Game 1. His GAA skyrocketed to a 3.40 while his save percentage dipped to .891.</p>

<p>Since taking over for Fleury, Vokoun and the Penguins are 6-1.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time in Fleury&apos;s career that he&apos;s folded come playoff time.</p>

<p>He was touched for 26 goals in six games as the Penguins got bounced in the first round by the Flyers last year.</p>

<p>In 2010-11, the Penguins lost in seven games in the first round to the Tampa Bay Lightning with Fleury between the pipes.</p>

<p>Learning from these past episodes, Pittsburgh decided to finally address its goaltending in the offseason and so far it&apos;s worked out nicely.</p>

<p>And Vokoun wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. It&apos;s a second chance opportunity for him. The former Washington Capitals goalie missed the playoffs last season because of a groin injury.</p>

<p>The Capitals beat Boston in the first-round with Braden Holtby in net then fell to the New York Rangers in the conference semis.</p>

<p>So can Vokoun keep up his stellar run against a Bruins team who also carries scoring threats in forwards David Krejci, Nathan Horton and Brad Marchand, defenseman Johnny Boychuk and rookie phenomenon Torey Krug?</p>

<p>One player who had success against Vokoun during the regular season, but hasn&apos;t made a ton of noise yet is Tyler Seguin. Seguin scored in all three meetings with Pittsburgh. In two of those, Vokoun was in net.</p>

<p>Seguin potted his first goal of the playoffs in Game 4 of their conference semis series with the Rangers and also assisted. In Game 5, he assisted on Krug&apos;s power-play goal to even the score at 1.</p>

<p>Maybe this could be the series where the Bruins&apos; 2010 No. 2 overall pick breaks loose.</p>

<p><q>We kind of made the decision for me to play again,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>I&apos;m happy to be back.</q></p>

<p>Seidenberg hasn&apos;t seen game action since Game 7 of the Bruins&apos; first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>

<p>He kept grabbing his left leg after landing awkwardly during his first shift and finished with just 37 seconds of ice time.</p>

<p>Saturday, Seidenberg was reunited with defensive partner Zdeno Chara and logged 23:37.</p>

<p>Rookie Dougie Hamilton sat out.</p>

<p>Seidenberg was on the ice for Gregory Campbell&apos;s empty-netter with 50.4 seconds left in the third period as the Bruins closed out their series with a 3-1 win to move on to the Eastern Conference finals.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s not always easy to come back, especially in the playoffs,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>To match the intensity and fit right in, especially when the team has played so well. For the most part, I think it was OK.</q></p>

<p>Seidenberg absorbed a couple of big hits from Rangers center Chris Kreider who registered six.</p>

<p>On one of them, Seidenberg lost his balance and fell hard into the end boards.</p>

<p><q>I lost a little bit of my breath,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>That came back a little bit later, but for the most part, again, it was a good hit. Just just have to shake it off and keep going.</q></p>

<p>While watching from the sidelines, Seidenberg has been very impressed with the work by the young defensemen throughout the series, especially Torey Krug.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s unbelievable, the poise he has with the puck,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>He&apos;s got great skating legs and he jumps into the open areas. And you saw those one-timers he had the last couple of games. They&apos;re very nice shots. They&apos;re perfect shots. It&apos;s nice to see a guy like Torey play so well.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs2" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Shawn Thornton on fight with Rangers&apos; Derek Dorsett: &lsquo;It&apos;s over now. The series is over.&rsquo;</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; Prior to Game 5 of the Bruins&apos; Eastern Conference semifinal series with the New York Rangers, Shawn Thornton said that he would fight if he had to.</p>

<p>It didn&apos;t take long as the Bruins enforcer dropped the gloves with Derek Dorsett in the neutral zone at 6:49 of the first period to the delight of the TD Garden sellout crowd of 17,565.</p>

<p>The linesmen struggled to separate the two with Thornton still wanting to land blows with Dorsett on his knees on the ice.</p>

<p><q>Chalk it up to many coffees, I guess,</q> Thornton said of what set him off. <q>It&apos;s over now. The series is over. I&apos;m not going to be that guy afterwards to talk about it. I thought he was trying to take liberties on my linemate. I wasn&apos;t OK with that, and that&apos;s the end of it. We were both upset at the end, doesn&apos;t happen too often, but a little wound up (Saturday) I guess.</q></p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/__0wtHN2S_k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>Dorsett has been a pest all series.</p>

<p>He tried multiple times in Game 4 to coax the Bruins to drop the gloves when his team was down 2-0.</p>

<p>In Game 2 Dorsett initiated with Gregory Campbell after the Rangers went down 5-2 by a goal from Milan Lucic.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien said Friday that he didn&apos;t want to see his fourth line in the penalty box because of fighting, feeling New York would have an advantage in the trade off.</p>

<h2 id="ecs3" class="">Gregory Campbell, Torey Krug, help propel Boston Bruins to Eastern Conference finals with 3-1 win over New York Rangers in Game 5</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins&apos; fourth line of Daniel Paille, Gregory Campbell and Shawn Thornton isn&apos;t an ordinary fourth line.</p>

<p>They&apos;ve been pivotal throughout the NHL playoffs and once again proved to be difference-makers.</p>

<p>Campbell sent the TD Garden sellout crowd of 17,565 into rapture when he scored into the empty New York Rangers net with 50.4 seconds remaining in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Saturday night.</p>

<p>It was his second goal of the game and third of the series, and closed book on the Rangers&apos; season as the Bruins won 3-1 to capture the best-of-seven series three games to one.</p>

<p>Boston will play the Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference finals.</p>

<p><q>We know that we&apos;re important to this team whether we&apos;re scoring or not,</q> Campbell said. <q>We know that this team is built on the play of four lines and we need everybody. Everybody really accepts their role and is humble in this room.</q></p>

<p>Campbell&apos;s first goal at 13:41 of the second period ended up as the game-winner, thanks to a great read and stickwork by Paille.</p>

<p>Paille intercepted New York defenseman Roman Hamrlik clearing pass and weaved his way through traffic with Thornton and Campbell driving to the net.</p>

<p>Campbell got his stick on a bouncing puck after Thornton&apos;s shot in front and poked it through before being toppled by Rangers center Michael Haley behind the net.</p>

<p><q>Our line, a lot of our success comes from the speed of Danny,</q> Campbell said. <q>He creates a lot with his speed. Not only 5-on-5, but on the penalty kill, you see that he’s often creating a lot of chances and beating guys. We kind of like to work off each other’s strengths ... he was determined to get that puck.</q></p>

<p>Another Bruin making a name for himself in the playoffs is rookie defenseman Torey Krug, who has become Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist&apos;s worst nightmare.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s one of the best goaltenders in the world,</q> Krug said. <q>It&apos;s a great feeling I was able to capitalize on some opportunities, and hopefully we can keep it going.</q></p>

<p>With Mats Zuccarello in the box for hooking, Krug and the rest of the Bruins&apos; power-play unit struck once again.</p>

<p>Tyler Seguin delivered a cross-ice feed and Krug blasted it past Lundqvist (29 saves) at 3:48 of the second period to tie the game at 1.</p>

<p>It was Krug&apos;s third power-play strike of the series and his fourth goal overall.</p>

<p>Fans started to chant <q>Kruuuuug</q> every time he touched the puck.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s a great feeling,</q> Krug said. <q>Sometimes the team needs a little boost, and I can be that guy every now and then.</q></p>

<p><q>I start to expect it from him now, right?</q> Thornton said. <q>I&apos;m happy no matter who puts it in, but obviously happy for him. He&apos;s played such a big role since he&apos;s been up (from Providence) so I&apos;m happy for him to have the success on the scoreboard too.</q></p>

<p>Momentum shifted the Bruins&apos; way as they outshot New York 14-3 in a four-minute span after Krug&apos;s tally.</p>

<p>The Rangers opened the scoring on the power play at 10:39 of the first period.</p>

<p>With David Krejci off for cross-checking, Brian Boyle screened netminder Tuukka Rask (28 saves), and Dan Girardi ripped a shot from the high slot.</p>

<p>But that was Rask&apos;s only blemish. He went on to make several critical stops to keep Boston on top 2-1.</p>

<p>Rask&apos;s biggest save was on Ryan Callahan at 8:38 of the third period when he stoned the Rangers captain on a breakaway to preserve the one-goal lead.</p>

<p><q>We definitely didn&apos;t want to go back to New York,</q> Rask said. <q>We felt like we should have finished the series off last game, but we didn&apos;t play good enough ... it&apos;s big to get a couple of days off and get some rest for the guys.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs4" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Shawn Thornton says he&apos;ll fight if he has to in Game 5 vs. New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_shawn_thornton_says_hell_fight_if_he_has_to_in_game_5_vs_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-25T16:49-05:00" pubdate>May 25, 2013, 4:49 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Bruins&apos; fourth line of Daniel Paille, Gregory Campbell and Shawn Thornton has proven its value in the playoffs.</p>

<p>And their Eastern conference semifinal matchup vs. the New York Rangers has been no different.</p>

<p>The threesome have combined for nine points in 11 games, six against the Rangers.</p>

<p>Paille, in particular, has been a difference-maker.</p>

<p>He netted the game-winning strike at 16:29 of the third period in the Bruins&apos; 2-1 Game 3 win, which gave them a 3-0 series advantage. Before that, he assisted on defenseman Johnny Boychuk&apos;s goal to jumpstart Boston&apos;s rally.</p>

<p>Thornton had a hand with assists to both Boychuk and Paille&apos;s goals. Campbell also had a helper on Paille&apos;s.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien knows the importance of his energy line.</p>

<p>Julien said during Friday&apos;s practice that he would rather have those guys on the ice rather than in the penalty box for fighting as the Bruins head into Game 5 with a commanding 3-1 series lead.</p>

<p><q>The guys on my fourth line, to me, aren&apos;t worth the trade off with their fourth line right now,</q> Julien told the Boston Herald. <q>Those guys are pretty valuable players for us. So whichever way they see their players, I certainly don&apos;t want to see one of mine necessarily in the penalty box with one of theirs, because it plays to their advantage.</q></p>

<p>Prior to Game 5, Thornton was asked about Julien&apos;s comments.</p>

<p><q>I honestly try not to pay attention to what&apos;s going on outside of the locker room,</q> Thornton said. &ldquo;I wasn&apos;t aware (he said that) so this kind of shocked me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&apos;ve been contributing so far in these playoffs and we hope we can continue to contribute. But that being said, if people are taking liberties and trying to take advantage of any of the guys, it doesn&apos;t mean those things are sewn onto our sleeves.</q></p>

<p>Rangers winger Derek Dorsett tried multiple times in Game 4 to coax the Bruins to drop the gloves. This was when New York was down 2-0, before netminder Tuukka Rask took an awkward tumble and Carl Hagelin&apos;s shot slid by him to cut the lead in half.</p>

<p><q>Our line&apos;s been fairly good, but at the same time whether it&apos;s the playoffs or the regular season, we had just scored our second goal,</q> Thornton said. <q>I felt we had momentum and that was more of a reason than anything else I probably wouldn&apos;t have fought during that time in any game ... I wouldn&apos;t read too much into it other than the fact that I&apos;ve been doing this for a long time.</q></p>

<p>The last time anyone dropped the gloves was in Game 2 when Dorsett initiated with Campbell after the Rangers went down 5-2 by a goal from Milan Lucic.</p></p>

<p><strong>SVEDBERG RECALLED:</strong> The Bruins recalled goalie Niklas Svedberg from their AHL affiliate Providence on Friday.</p>

<p>He is so far the only player to join Boston after the P-Bruins blew a 3-0 series lead to the Wilke-Barre Scranton Penguins in the second round of the Calder Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>The Sweden native went 6-6 with a 3.29 goals-against average and .889 save percentage.</p>

<p>During the regular season he compiled a 37-8-2 record in 48 games with a 2.17 goals-against average and a .925 save percentage, to rank fifth and third in the league, respectively. He also posted four shutouts.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s here. He&apos;s had a great year,</q> Julien said. <q>He deserves to be here with us, but certainly is going to help us along the way here giving Tuukka some rest (during morning skates) when needed.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs5" class="">Boston Bruins forward Tyler Seguin needs to find his confidence again</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_forward_tyler_seguin_needs_to_find_his_confidence_again.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-23T15:35-05:00" pubdate>May 23, 2013, 3:35 PM EST</a><time></p>
<p>There&apos;s a lot going right for the Boston Bruins in their Eastern Conference semifinals series with the New York Rangers.</p>

<p>Netminder Tuukka Rask has been solid.</p>

<p>The defensive corps has accounted for half of the team&apos;s goals headed into Game 4 Thursday night.</p>

<p>Rookies Matt Bartkowski and Torey Krug have become difference makers.</p>

<p>Boston is rolling four strong lines.</p>

<p>And Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron carried their Game 7 first-round heroics vs. Toronto into this series.</p>

<p>But someone is missing in action: Tyler Seguin.</p>

<p>Through 10 playoff games, Seguin has just one assist. It came on Bergeron&apos;s overtime winner in Game 7 as the Bruins rallied from a three-goal deficit with 11 minutes to play.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien moved Seguin down to the third line with Rich Peverley and Chris Kelly to start the game, but he was reunited with Marchand and Bergeron in overtime.</p>

<p>However, once the New York series started, Seguin was back on the third line while Jaromir Jagr was moved to the second line with Bergeron and Marchand.</p>

<p>His ice time has taken a hit as well. Seguin had a playoff-low 10 minutes, 41 seconds in Game 3 against New York.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time Seguin has struggled.</p>

<p>During the lockout, he chose to play overseas to keep his legs fresh. He tore up the Swiss League for EHC Biel with 25 goals and 40 points in 29 games.</p>

<p>Once the lockout ended, Seguin had a hard time adjusting to the smaller ice surface in the NHL.</p>

<p>It took him five games to pot his first goal and he didn&apos;t really find a groove until early March.</p>

<p>He wound up second on the team behind Marchand (18) with 16 goals.</p>

<p>The last time Seguin scored was April 20 in a 3-2 loss to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old has had opportunities against Toronto and New York.</p>

<p>He used to finish breakaways and made opposing netminders look silly.</p>

<p>Remember when Seguin split defensemen, kept possession of the puck and buried shots in back of the net?</p>

<p>This almost seems like a distant memory now.</p>

<p>In his playoff debut in 2011 of the Eastern Conference finals, the 2010 No. 2 overall pick dazzled. He registered a goal and assist against Tampa Bay in Game 1 then doubled it in Game 2.</p>

<p>His outburst caused Bruins fans flip out questioning why Seguin was a healthy scratch through the first two rounds against Montreal and Philadelphia in the first place.</p>

<p>This is what he said following Game 2:</p>

<p><q>Whenever I face adversity, I always try to take a negative and turn it into a positive,</q> Seguin said on being benched. <q>Watching the first two rounds, I could still learn a lot and see the game from up top. So whenever I get the opportunity again, whether it&apos;s getting cut in World Juniors and going back to OHL or being in the press box and coming back to the team, I want to take advantage of every opportunity.</q></p>

<p>The only reason why Seguin was given a shot was because Bergeron sustained a concussion in Game 4 of the conference semis.</p>

<p>However after Seguin&apos;s coming out party, he only had one assist in the next 11 games.</p>

<p>Last season, it took him until Game 6 of the first-round series with Washington to score. He finished with two goals and an assist as Boston got bounced in seven games.</p>

<p>So what&apos;s wrong with Seguin?</p>

<p>He has the skill, speed and talent.</p>

<p>Marchand admitted that he was lacking confidence against Toronto and wasn&apos;t playing his game.</p>

<p>This seems to be the same case with Seguin. He doesn&apos;t appear to be injured.</p>

<p>All Bruins fans can hope for is that he&apos;ll wake up before the playoffs are over.</p></p>

<h2 id="ecs6" class="">Memories of 2011 Stanley Cup run reminiscent with Boston Bruins 1 win away from East Finals</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/memories_of_2011_stanley_cup_run_reminiscent_with_boston_bruins_1_win_away_from_east_finals.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-22T17:08-05:00" pubdate>May 22, 2013, 5:08 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Well now ... no one expected this.</p>

<p>When it looked apparent that the New York Rangers would come away with a gritty 1-0 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semis at Madison Square Garden Tuesday night, the Boston Bruins spoiled it with two third period goals.</p>

<p>Now the Bruins are a win away from advancing to the conference finals.</p>

<p>Why does this seem all too familiar?</p>

<p>It&apos;s almost impossible not to think about 2011 and the Bruins&apos; magical run for the Stanley Cup.</p>

<p>Boston beat the Montreal Canadiens in seven games of the first round. They won Game 7 in overtime fashion. Boston almost mirrored it with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Not the exact sequence, but you understand the point.</p>

<p>The Blueshirts were suppose to frustrate the Bruins by taking away shooting lanes with their shot-block regiment.</p>

<p>They seemed they did a better job of it Tuesday, however the scoresheet says differently.</p>

<p>Boston was credited with 20 blocked shots to New York&apos;s 17. New York only registered 12 in Game 2 after putting up a gaudy 29 in Game 1.</p>

<p>But the Rangers aren&apos;t the 2011 Philadelphia Flyers ... right?</p>

<p>The Bruins made a mockery of netminders Brian Boucher and Sergei Bobrovsky (now a Vezina Trophy finalist for that matter) as they potted 20 goals in their series sweep.</p>

<p>Henrik Lundqvist isn&apos;t Boucher or Bobrovsky from that season. Not by a long shot. After being shaky for the first two games against Boston, he looked like his poised self in Game 3.</p>

<p>He robbed both Chris Kelly and Tyler Seguin from breakaways in the opening period. And that &apos;uh oh&apos; feeling had to pass through Bruins&apos; fans minds.</p>

<p>Lundqvist made many flashy stops, but in the end, the Bruins&apos; fourth line came through clutch again.</p>

<p>Winger Daniel Paille assisted on defenseman Johnny Boychuk&apos;s strike, then scored the game-winner with 3:31 remaining.</p>

<p>Paille&apos;s linemate Shawn Thornton assisted on both goals.</p>

<p>Boychuk has transformed into a playoff scoring threat. He has four tallies in 10 games. During the regular season, he had just one. And wouldn&apos;t you know? It came against the Rangers in the season opener.</p>

<p>But besides Boychuk being a Rangers-killer, he&apos;s been one of the Bruins most consistent defenders. He&apos;s blocked 37 shots &mdash; nine against New York &mdash; and hasn&apos;t missed a shift.</p>

<p>He is a true warrior. It&apos;s hard not to admire and respect Johnny Boychuk.</p>

<p>And let&apos;s not overshadow the play of Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask. Rask may not be getting as much attention as he should be, but he is another reason why the Bruins are in this position.</p>

<p>Now the question is, unlike their first-round series vs. Toronto, can the Bruins seal the deal in Game 4?</p>

<p>It would be huge in numerous ways.</p>

<p>Most importantly though, it can buy time for injured veterans, Dennis Seidenberg, Wade Redden and Andrew Ference to solidify Boston&apos;s defensive core.</p>

<p>Rookies Matt Bartkowski, Torey Krug and Dougie Hamilton filled that void this series so far.</p>

<p>If Boston can get everyone back healthy, it makes a strong case to go deep again.</p>

<h2 id="ecs7" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; Tuukka Rask the better goalie so far in playoff series vs. New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_tuukka_rask_the_better_goalie_so_far_in_playoff_series_vs_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-21T16:01-05:00" pubdate>May 21, 2013, 4:01 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Few could have guessed Boston Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask would have the upper hand on Rangers counterpart Henrik Lundqvist entering Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.</p>

<p>But that&apos;s the case as the Bruins enter with a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series.</p>

<p>Lundqvist gave up a playoff-high five goals in Sunday&apos;s Game 2 loss at TD Garden. His previous high was three, which he allowed three times against the Washington Capitals in the first round and at Boston in Game 1.</p>

<p>The Vezina Trophy finalist hasn&apos;t looked sharp, giving up a lot of juicy rebounds and failing to be his dominant self when key stops are required.</p>

<p>Rask on the other hand, has fared better. He&apos;s given up two goals apiece in the first two games, and has smothered loose pucks to prevent the Rangers from capitalizing on second-chance opportunities.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s been incredible,</q> Bruins winger Brad Marchand said. <q>He showed it all year that he&apos;s a great goalie, and he&apos;s stepping up to another level right now. If we&apos;re going to have any shot at beating New York, we need him to continue to be great.</q></p>

<p>When asked what he thought of Rask&apos;s play, Marchand joked, <q>Oh I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t really watch him. He&apos;s just so big. Even in practice, he seems to take up the whole net; he&apos;s very quick. He&apos;s definitely a great goalie.</q></p>

<p>Rask ranks sixth and ninth, respectively, in save percentage (.928) and goals-against average (2.32) among playoff goaltenders entering Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Lundqvist is fourth with a .935 save percentage and sixth with a 2.10 GAA.</p>

<h2 id="ecs8" class="">Defenseman Dennis Seidenberg likely remains out for Game 3 as Boston Bruins gear up for New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/defenseman_dennis_seidenberg_likely_remains_out_for_game_3_as_boston_bruins_gear_up_for_new_york_ran.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-21T15:03-05:00"pubdate>May 21, 2013, 3:03 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>It still doesn&apos;t look good for Boston Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg.</p>

<p>Seidenberg, who&apos;s been bothered by pain in his left leg, participated in an optional skate Tuesday morning at Madison Square Garden, but according to coach Claude Julien, the German workhorse will likely remain out for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Rangers.</p>

<p><q>I don&apos;t think (Seidenberg) will be out for the warmup tonight,</q> Julien said in a pregame press conference. <q>If he plays, I&apos;ll be as surprised as anybody else. It doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;ll be able to play just yet.</q></p>

<p>Seidenberg skated the last two days along with fellow defenseman Wade Redden. Redden missed Game 5 of the first-round series with Toronto with an undisclosed injury, but returned for the next game. He did not play in Game 7.</p>

<p>Julien said Redden will be out there for warmups Tuesday, but it&apos;s still a day-to-day situation.</p>

<p>Julien explained after Monday&apos;s practice before the team departed for New York that he needs the OK from the medical staff before the decision rests in his hands.</p>

<p><q>There&apos;s no gray area when it comes to that stuff,</q> he said.</p>

<p>Comcast SportsNet&apos;s Mike Giardi tweeted Seidenberg was <q>moving slowly and stiffly</q> on the ice with an <q>occasional grimace.</q></p>

<p>Seidenberg hasn&apos;t played since the first period of Game 7 vs. Toronto.</p>

<p>The injury was sustained after his first shift when he fell and landed awkwardly, according to WEEI.com&apos;s DJ Bean.</p>

<p>He logged just 37 seconds of ice time.</p>

<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference (lower-body injury) didn&apos;t make the trip to New York. He hasn&apos;t skated since Game 5 vs. Toronto.</p>

<p><strong>TOPPING THE BOARD:</strong> Bruins are dominating the Stanley Cup playoffs leaderboard. Heading into Game 3, center David Krejci leads the league with 16 points, two ahead of Pittsburgh&apos;s Evgeni Malkin.</p>

<p>Winger Milan Lucic and defenseman Zdeno Chara rank seventh, with 10 points apiece, while Nathan Horton is on the Top 10 bubble with nine.</p>

<p>In plus/minus, the Bruins&apos; top line of Horton (14), Krejci (12) and Lucic (11) filled the top three spots. Chara is fifth with a plus-7.</p>

<p>Netminder Tuukka Rask comes in at sixth and ninth, respectively, in save percentage (.928) and goals-against average (2.32).</p></p>

<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_young_defensemen_make_case_to_stay_in_lineup_once_veterans_heal.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-20T15:20-05:00" pubdate>May 20, 2013, 3:20 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Torey Krug has been a breath of fresh air for the Boston Bruins&apos; defensive corps.</p>

<p>The undrafted 22-year-old was signed as a free agent out of Michigan State last season.</p>

<p>Who knew a season later that Krug, along with Matt Bartkowski, would get the call in the Stanley Cup playoffs to help fill in for a trio of injured veterans and become a difference-maker.</p>

<p>Through the first two games of the Eastern Conference semifinals vs. the New York Rangers, Krug has shown amazing puck-handling skills.</p>

<p>In the Bruins&apos; 5-2 win in Game 2 Sunday, he received two tough passes by turning one into a goal and the other an assist.</p>

<p>Nathan Horton&apos;s first-period feed went between Krug&apos;s legs, but he demonstrated great control and snapped a shot past Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist to put Boston on the board first.</p>

<p>In the second, Krug kicked the puck with his right skate and let his stickwork do the rest. Gregory Campbell knocked home Krug&apos;s rebound after it hit Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi&apos;s skate, which gave the Bruins a 2-1 edge.</p>

<p>At this point, it would be absurd to pull Krug from the lineup.</p>

<p>Bartkowski has also made a strong case to stay put. He logged 20:52 of ice time in Game 2 &mdash; third-highest on the team &mdash; recorded a team-best five hits and picked up an assist on Brad Marchand&apos;s goal in the third.</p>

<p><q>They just seem to be playing with so much confidence,</q> Marchand said. <q>You don&apos;t expect guys to come in and play as good as those two have ... we&apos;re very impressed with them.</q></p>

<p><q>We need them to step up for us to have a good chance to win the game with a couple of our veterans out,</q> fellow defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>They&apos;ve been doing a good job by keeping it simple, getting shots through and scoring when they get that chance.</q></p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien is going to have some tough decisions to make once those vets are healthy again. And that could be soon.</p>

<p>Dennis Seidenberg (lower-body injury) and Wade Redden (undisclosed) practiced with the team Monday at TD Garden before their departure for Tuesday&apos;s Game 3 in New York.</p>

<p>Both traveled with the team, but no return date has been set.</p>

<p>With Krug and Bartkowski dazzling, the likely odd man out is Dougie Hamilton, who wasn&apos;t as impressive in Game 2 and has been streaky throughout the playoffs.</p>

<p>Even though Hamilton has a height advantage, towering over the 5-foot-9 Krug at 6-5, that may not matter. Nevertheless, Krug knows he has to stand out in another way as a result of that discrepancy.</p>

<p><q>For me, you&apos;ve got to be confident with the puck,</q> Krug said. <q>If I&apos;m not making plays, I&apos;m not going to be effective, and guys are going to go out there and they&apos;re just going to find a 6-2 guy who can do the same thing without the puck.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs10" class="">Boston Bruins center Gregory Campbell assist shy of Gordie Howe hat trick in Game 2 win over New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_center_gregory_campbell_assist_shy_of_gordie_how_hat_trick_in_game_2_win_over_new_york.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-19T20:13-05:00" pubdate>May 19, 2013, 8:13 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Fourth line centerman Gregory Campbell has been quiet since the Boston Bruins&apos; 4-1, Game 1 win in their first-round playoff series vs. the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>

<p>But that wasn&apos;t the case in the Bruins&apos; 5-2 defeat over the New York Rangers Sunday in Game 2 of the conference semis.</p>

<p>Campbell finished an assist shy of a Gordie Howe hat trick.</p>

<p>Campbell ripped in rookie defenseman Torey Krug&apos;s rebound from the left point, which gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead at 2:24 of the second period.</p>

<p>It was Campbell&apos;s first goal of the playoffs and the second of his career.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s a really good feeling,</q> Campbell said. <q>It&apos;s a lot of pressure for those top guys. (David) Krejci&apos;s line and (Patrice Bergeron&apos;s) line of late have been relied upon heavily to produce...it&apos;s a tough job, especially when you&apos;re playing against a real sound defensive team.</q></p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien hasn&apos;t backed down by giving Campbell and his linemates, Daniel Paille and Shawn Thornton valuable ice time.</p>

<p>The trio had multiple scoring chances in Game 1 and were finally able to finish.</p>

<p><q>They&apos;re not afraid to throw pucks at the net,</q> Julien said. <q>Their goals aren&apos;t necessarily highlight goals, but they&apos;re important goals as you saw (Sunday).</q></p>

<p>When Boston went up 5-2 courtesy of left winger Milan Lucic, Campbell and Rangers winger Derek Dorsett engaged in a fight. It was the Bruins&apos; first postseason scrap.</p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYlutHwHO-4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>The last time Campbell fought was against Carolina Hurricanes winger Nicolas Blanchard on April 13. Campbell had five fights during the regular season.</p>

<p>Campbell didn&apos;t have much to say about the bout.</p>

<p><q>In a case like that, nobody really wants to back down,</q> Campbell said. <q>I don&apos;t have really much to say about it. It happened ... obviously (Dorsett) wants to create some energy and momentum going for his team, and I don&apos;t want to back down for our team either.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs11" class="">Brad Marchand-Patrice Bergeron magic continues as Boston Bruins beat New York Rangers 5-2 in Game 2</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/brad_marchand-patrice_bergeron_magic_continues_as_boston_bruins_beat_new_york_rangers_5-2_in_game_2.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-19T17:55-05:00" pubdate>May 19, 2013, 5:55 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; When Bruins linemates Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron are clicking, the pair has proven lethal for the opposition.</p>

<p>For the third straight game Sunday, that was the case.</p>

<p>Bergeron delivered a perfect tape-to-tape cross-ice feed to a driving Marchand, who tucked it past New York Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist from the edge of the crease to give the Bruins a 4-2 lead 26 seconds into the third period at TD Garden.</p>

<p>That goal was more than enough as Boston cruised to a 5-2 win and a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>

<p>The best-of-7 series shifts to Madison Square Garden for Game 3 Tuesday.</p>

<p><q>Obviously in the Toronto series, it didn&apos;t go the way we would have liked, but things are clicking a little bit better right now,</q> Marchand said of his chemistry with Bergeron. <q>We both have our legs and we&apos;re getting some lucky bounces.</q></p>

<p>Marchand and Bergeron have combined for 11 points dating to Game 6 of the first round vs. Toronto.</p>

<p>Right winger Tyler Seguin, normally with them on the second line, has been the odd man out. In a total funk with just one assist in nine games, Seguin logged just 11:10 of ice time Sunday.</p>

<p>The Garden faithful of 17,565 were in full force with taunts of <q>Lund-qvist</q> after left winger Milan Lucic gave Boston a 5-2 lead with 7:21 remaining.</p>

<p>He finished off pivotman David Krejci&apos;s shot attempt.</p>

<p>The Rangers then initiated a statement fight when winger Derek Dorsett dropped the gloves with Bruins center Gregory Campbell, but that only fired up the crowd.</p>

<p><q>In a case like that, nobody really wants to back down,</q> Campbell said. <q>I don&apos;t have really much to say about it. It happened ... obviously (Dorsett) wants to create some energy and momentum going for his team, and I don&apos;t want to back down for our team either.</q></p>

<p>On 4-on-4 play off a faceoff, Marchand controlled the puck along the side boards and set up defenseman Johnny Boychuk to give the Bruins a 3-2 lead at 12:09 of the second period.</p>

<p>Boston was in full control, even when it was a man down.</p>

<p>The Rangers&apos; disastrous power-play antics continued as they finished 0 for 5 to drop to a playoff-worst 2 for 36.</p>

<p>New York struggled to keep possession in the Bruins&apos; zone. Passes were bobbled, intercepted and easily cleared by the Boston penalty-killers.</p>

<p>Boston&apos;s first goal was a beautiful transition play.</p>

<p>Defenseman Adam McQuaid poke-checked the puck from Rangers center Brian Boyle and shifted momentum downice.</p>

<p>Rookie blueliner Torey Krug controlled a tough between-the-legs pass from winger Nathan Horton and snapped it past Lundqvist (27 saves) at 5:17 of the first period.</p>

<p>It was Krug&apos;s second goal in as many games.</p>

<p><q>That was great,</q> Boychuk said of McQuaid&apos;s play. <q>It could have been a breakaway, but he did a good job defensively.</q></p>

<p>Krug was involved again at 2:24 of the second.</p>

<p>Manning the left point, he shot the puck off Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi&apos;s skate. It bounced to Campbell in the slot and he ripped it to give Boston a 2-1 lead.</p>

<p>But the Rangers evened it up quickly.</p>

<p>Sniper Rick Nash won a race with Bruins captain Zdeno Chara and buried his first goal of the playoffs 64 seconds later.</p>

<p>Ryan Callahan netted the Rangers&apos; first goal at 8:01 after Marchand mishandled the puck in the neutral zone. Callahan outraced Bruins defenseman Dougie Hamilton, deked and victimized netminder Tuukka Rask (33 saves).</p>

<p><q>I was just spinning a little bit there,</q> Rask said. <q>He&apos;s got pretty quick hands and quick speed, so it&apos;s tough to adjust sometimes.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs12" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk a true playoff warrior</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_defenseman_johnny_boychuk_a_true_playoff_warrior.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-19T13:39" pubdate>May 19, 2013, 1:39 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Johnny Boychuk has taken a beating this postseason.</p>

<p>The Boston Bruins defenseman hasn&apos;t gone a game without taking a shot somewhere off his body.</p>

<p>He tops the NHL playoffs with 32 blocked shots through eight games.</p>

<p>And he&apos;s had a few close calls.</p>

<p>His latest was in Game 1 of the Bruins&apos; Eastern Conference semifinals. Boychuk absorbed a hard hit from New York Rangers winger Taylor Pyatt in the corner of the Bruins&apos; zone. He laid facedown on the ice for several seconds, but was OK as he returned shortly.</p>

<p>Pyatt was assessed for boarding.</p>

<p>Heading into Game 2 Sunday at TD Garden, Boychuk said that he feels good after a few days off and credited the team&apos;s trainers.</p>

<p><q>There&apos;s a couple of bumps and bruises just like the regular playoffs, but you know having a couple days off, it helps,</q> Boychuk said. <q>Our trainers do a great job, they always do the right things. It&apos;s not too hard when you know you&apos;re getting good care.</q></p>

<p>Already down three defensemen in Dennis Seidenberg (lower-body), Andrew Ference (lower-body) and Wade Redden (undisclosed) the Bruins cannot afford to lose anyone else. But Boychuk urged it doesn&apos;t mean his game should be altered in fear getting hurt.</p>

<p><q>No, you can&apos;t because you know as soon as you do that, then bad things will happen,</q> he said. <q>You got to go out there and play your game. There&apos;s always going to be bumps and bruises along the way, that&apos;s part of the game and you have to battle through it.</q></p>

<p>The trio of rookies filling in for the veterans; Dougie Hamilton, Matt Bartkowski and Torey Krug have given the defensive corps a huge lift. Not knowing exactly what to expect from them, they could end up being keys to the series.</p>

<p>Bartkowski played heavy minutes in Game 1 logging 26:41, which was the third highest on the team.</p>

<p>Captain Zdeno Chara (38:02) and Boychuk 26:55 were first and second, respectively.</p>

<p>Krug scored a power-play goal to tie the game at 2. Hamilton picked up the assist along with left winger Brad Marchand.</p>

<p>The defensive combinations consisted of Chara and Hamilton, Bartkowski with Boychuk and Krug and Adam McQuaid.</p>

<p><q>They&apos;ve played with numerous partners so it&apos;s pretty easy to jump in,</q> Boychuk said.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien said in a brief pregame press conference that both Seidenberg and Redden skated Sunday morning, but won&apos;t be available for Game 2.</p>

<h2 id="ecs13" class="">Boston Bruins winger Brad Marchand looks like his normal self in Game 1 win over New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_winger_brad_marchand_looks_like_his_normal_self_in_game_1_win_over_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-17T15:10-05:00" pubdate>May 17, 2013, 3:10 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>It took Boston Bruins left winger Brad Marchand two games to score his first goal during the regular season.</p>

<p>In the NHL playoffs, Marchand needed a full eight games to find his sniping instinct.

<p>And he picked a critical time to get it done.</p>

<p>Marchand finished off center Patrice Bergeron&apos;s pass at 15:40 of overtime as the Bruins took Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series, 3-2 against the New York Rangers Thursday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p><q>I felt good. I felt pretty good last game too,</q> Marchand said. <q>Obviously the Toronto series wasn&apos;t my best series, but I felt good (Thursday) and just want to keep building on it.</q></p>

<p>The pesky winger led the Bruins in scoring with 18 goals and 36 points.</p>

<p>In Boston&apos;s first-round series with Toronto, he had three assists. One of them on Bergeron&apos;s overtime winner in Game 7 where the Bruins scored three times in the final 11 minutes &mdash; two in the last 90 seconds &mdash; to tie it.</p>

<p>After the Bruins&apos; epic win, which advanced them to the next round, Marchand said in the locker room how he wasn&apos;t playing his game and that his confidence wasn&apos;t there.</p>

<p>But once he took the ice for Game 1 against the Rangers, it was evident that Marchand was back to his normal style.</p>

<p>Not only did he score, he also assisted on rookie defenseman Torey Krug&apos;s power-play strike at 2:55 in the third period, which tied the game at 2.</p>

<p>Marchand was buzzing all night. He also had three takeaways and three shots on goal.</p>

<p>Prior to the game, Marchand received a text message of encouragement from former linemate, Mark Recchi, who retired after the Bruins won the Stanley Cup in 2011.</p>

<p><q>He told me to play my game and not to worry about anything else,</q> Marchand said. <q>The goals and stuff will come. It&apos;s nice to hear from him. He&apos;s obviously a guy that I went through a lot when I played with him and it was good to hear from him again.</q></p>

<p>With Marchand heating up, this is certainly good news for the Bruins as his availability was questioned Thursday morning when he left early from morning skate apparently in pain following 2-on-1 drills.</p>

<p>Marchand insisted he was fine and just wanted to save his energy until that night.</p>

<p><q>No, no, I wasn&apos;t worried at all,</q> he said. <q>I&apos;m serious I wanted to get off the ice. Claude (Julien) knows I hate morning skates. He used to yell at me when we won the Cup there because I wouldn&apos;t even take a stride. I just wanted to get off early.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs14" class="">New York Rangers coach John Tortorella reacts after Game 1 overtime loss to Boston Bruins</h2>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; New York Rangers coach John Tortorella wasn&apos;t too pleased after his team&apos;s 3-2 overtime loss in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals vs. the Boston Bruins Thursday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Bruins left winger Brad Marchand banked the winning shot at 15:40 off a pass from center Patrice Bergeron.</p>

<p>Boston dominated the extra period landing 16 shots on net and pressed the Rangers in their own zone.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Tortorella&apos;s reaction from his postgame press conference, which lasted a whole minute and 42 seconds.</p>

<p><b>On the effect the Bruins&apos; power play had in overtime:</b></p>
<p>In the overtime? We never regrouped.</p>

<p><b>On why it was so difficult to regroup:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, it was a surge. We couldn&apos;t stop it.</p>

<p><b>On having a goaltender that is very critical of himself and what he says to him:</b></p>
<p>What are you asking me? Your questions are too complicated.</p>

<p><b>On Henrik Lundqvist making 15 saves in overtime and still being hard on himself:</b></p>
<p>Is that right? He&apos;s a competitor.</p>

<p><b>On whether he was happy with the overall effort of the team:</b></p>
<p>Yeah, we were OK. We&apos;re going to need to be better. If we&apos;re going to win our next game here we need to be better.</p>

<p><b>On whether he was happy with the Rangers&apos; ability to control the Bruins&apos; offensive chances:</b></p>
<p>I thought it was pretty even going into overtime. But we got spanked in the overtime.</p></p>

<h2 id="ecs15" class="">Boston Bruins rookies Torey Krug, Dougie Hamilton, contribute in Game 1 win over New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_rookies_torey_krug_dougie_hamilton_contribute_in_game_1_win_over_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-17T00:30-05:00" pubdate>May 17, 2013, 12:30 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The future of the Boston Bruins&apos; defensive corps seems to be in good hands.</p>

<p>Rookies Torey Krug, Dougie Hamilton and Matt Bartkowski were all hard at work in the Bruins&apos; 3-2 overtime win over the New York Rangers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semis Thursday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Krug scored the tying-goal at 2:55 of the third period on the power play and no one scored until the overtime session.</p>

<p>Hamilton and left winger Brad Marchand assisted on the play.</p>

<p><q>I just remember moving the puck to (Marchand) and he was getting in the zone with speed on the power play, and he curled up and gave it to Dougie,</q> Krug said. <q>Dougie made a great play by drawing a guy out to him and then he slid it over to me. I had a lot of time to take the shot.</q></p>

<p>Krug was recalled from Boston&apos;s AHL-affiliate Providence on Tuesday after Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg went down with a lower-body injury.</p>

<p>He had been playing in the Calder Cup playoffs and was excited about the call-up.</p>

<p><q>Right when I first got here I got that feeling. I&apos;m very comfortable with the group of guys in here,</q> Krug said. <q>I&apos;m comfortable in a sense that they were giving me the puck all night and they weren&apos;t nervous in that regard, so it was very exciting to get out there.</q></p>

<p>Though Bartkowski didn&apos;t register a point, he logged big minutes finishing with 26:42. He&apos;s been strong since the first-round series vs. Toronto after he was called up from Providence when blueliners Wade Redden and Andrew Ference got hurt.</p>

<p><q>I thought they played really well. They deserve a lot of credit for the way they handled themselves, all three of them,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>It was Torey&apos;s first game, obviously. Not only did he score a big goal, but he just moved that puck so well. A lot of times, he played against (the Rangers&apos;) third line which is a pretty heavy line. I thought he handled them extremely well.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecs16" class="">Brad Marchand scores in overtime to lift Boston Bruins, 3-2 in Game 1 vs. New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/brad_marchand_scores_in_overtime_to_lift_boston_bruins_3-2_in_game_1_vs_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-16T22:55-05:00" pubdate>May 16, 2013, 10:55 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; For the second time in four nights, the Boston Bruins had to settle it in overtime. And for the second time, they came out on top.</p>

<p>Center Patrice Bergeron found linemate Brad Marchand in the slot and stuffed the puck past New York Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist at 15:40 to give the Bruins a 3-2 win in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series Thursday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s kind of a blur,</q> Marchand said of the goal. <q>The second it goes in seeing everybody jump on the ice and surround you it&apos;s a bit of a blur, but obviously a huge adrenaline rush and very exciting.</q></p>

<p>Boston was able to cause a turnover in the neutral zone and create a 4 on 2 rush with Bergeron and Marchand leading the charge. But Bergeron gave props to Bruins captain Zdeno Chara.</p>

<p><q>On that play, if you look at it, it&apos;s a great play by (Chara) also just to get that real detail that goes a long way ... that poke check there set us free pretty much. We had some good speed because we were back-checking and just kept that speed going.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins gained confidence after their fourth power-play chance at 2:20 of overtime.</p>

<p>Bruins winger Rich Peverley drew an interference call on Ranger right winger Derek Dorsett.</p>

<p><q>I thought that on the power play we had created some chances and actually some really good scoring chances,</q> Chara said. <q>We also did a really good job blocking some shots and making some saves. We obviously didn&apos;t score but it gave us momentum.</q></p>

<p>Boston had a chance to end it in regulation on the man-advantage, but came up empty after peppering multiple shots at Lundqvist (45 saves) before time expired.</p>

<p>Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh spoiled the Bruins&apos; 1-0 lead with his first score of the playoffs with 1.3 seconds left in the second period.</p>

<p>Bruins left winger Tyler Seguin failed to clear the puck out of the zone and it instead found McDonagh&apos;s stick.</p>

<p>The Rangers carried the momentum 14 seconds into the third. Winger Carl Hagelin fed center Derek Stepan on a 2 on 1 break who shot it past Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask (33 saves) to put New York ahead, 2-1.</p>

<p>But the Bruins quickly found an answer on the power play and tied it at 2:55 off rookie defenseman Torey Krug.</p>

<p>With Rangers Steve Eminger in the box for holding, Krug banged it home from the left faceoff circle off feeds from Dougie Hamilton and Marchand.</p>

<p>Lundqvist flashed the leather around with a standout save on Chara&apos;s long wrister from the point at 10:22 in the second period.</p>

<p>But the Bruins captain got another try two minutes later. He ripped a shot from the high slot after a feed from center David Krejci that trickled through 5-hole.</p>

<p>Chara&apos;s strike snapped Lundqvist&apos;s shutout streak at 152 minutes and 23 seconds, which dated back to Game 6 of New York&apos;s first-round playoff series vs. Washington.</p>

<p><q>I think we&apos;re expecting (the Rangers to block shots) so we&apos;re trying to find ways to get around their shot blocking,</q> Chara said. <q>They&apos;re doing a good job on that usually.</q></p>

<p>Already scarce on defensemen the Bruins had another injury scare with Johnny Boychuk at 2:22 of the second period.</p>

<p>Boychuk absorbed a hard hit from Rangers winger Taylor Pyatt in the corner of the Bruins&apos; zone. He laid facedown on the ice for several seconds, but was OK as he returned shortly.</p>

<p>Pyatt was called for boarding to give Bruins their first power play bid.</p>

<p>With 31.6 seconds left in the first period Rangers defenseman Michael Del Zotto took a puck off the left side of his head off after blocking a shot from Bergeron.</p>

<p>He skated off on his own power with a trainer and returned for the second period.</p>

<p>The Bruins&apos; best scoring chance came with four minutes remaining in the first.</p>

<p>Hamilton shot the puck through traffic from the right point that nearly snuck through Lundqvist&apos;s pads. Lundqvist found the puck and covered it before Bruins left winger Milan Lucic got his stick on it.</p></p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins will kick off their Eastern Conference semifinal series with the New York Rangers without three of their key defensemen Thursday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Dennis Seidenberg (lower-body), Andrew Ference (lower-body) and Wade Redden (undisclosed) are all scratched.</p>

<p>Neither of them participated in morning skate.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien said it <q>doesn&apos;t look good.</q></p>

<p>Redden skated briefly Wednesday, but didn&apos;t practice with the team.</p>

<p>The veteran blueliner was out for Games 5 and 7 of Boston&apos;s first-round series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Ference missed the final two games. He&apos;s using crutches and a walking boot.</p>

<p>Seidenberg, Zdeno Chara&apos;s defensive partner, skated a total of 37 seconds in Game 7. Seidenberg never left the bench after his first shift. He took a quick spin on the ice after the first intermission, but kept grabbing his left leg and never returned.</p>

<p>This means the Bruins need rookies Dougie Hamilton, Matt Bartkowski and Torey Krug to step up.</p>

<p>Krug was called up from Boston&apos;s AHL affiliate Providence on Tuesday. The P-Bruins lead their best-of-seven Calder Cup semifinal series against the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins, three games to none.</p>

<p>The Michigan native has three assists and a minus-1 rating in seven playoff games.</p>

<p>This season Krug played in one NHL game against the Montreal Canadiens, on March 27, and recorded an assist.</p>

<p>Bartkowski has already made an impact for Boston, scoring the first goal in Game 7 before the Bruins&apos; rallied for their historic comeback.</p>

<p>Hamilton was paired with Chara. Bartkowski skated with Johnny Boychuk and Krug was with Adam McQuaid.</p>

<p>Bartkowski and Krug have been playing well in the minors, and both teams use the same system.</p>

<p><q>(Providence coach) Bruce Cassidy and his coaching staff seem to see the game the same way we do,</q> Julien said. <q>There&apos;s a good connection there in the way we coach our teams Very much the same approach ... it&apos;s an easy transition for players.</q></p>

<p>On the Rangers&apos; end, defenseman Marc Staal and forwards Ryane Clowe and Darroll Powe are all hurt.</p>

<p>None of them participated in morning skate.</p>

<p>Staal is battling blurred vision in his right eye after taking a slap shot to the face in March.</p>

<p>Powe collided with Washington Capitals right winger Joel Ward along the boards in Game 3 of their first-round series.</p>

<p>Capitals left winger Jason Chimera boarded Clowe in Game 5 and slammed his head off the glass.</p>

<h2 id="ecs18" class="">Netminder Tuukka Rask helped carry Boston Bruins to semifinal round vs. New York Rangers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/netminder_tuukka_rask_helped_carry_boston_bruins_to_semifinal_round_vs_new_york_rangers.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-15T17:05-05:00" pubdate>May 15, 2013, 5:05 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Heading into their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series, no one knew exactly what to expect from Boston Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask.</p>

<p>Would he be the dominant backstop or allow a few soft goals to sneak by?</p>

<p>After the Bruins&apos; historic Game 7 comeback Monday against the Toronto Maple Leafs, no one should be talking about how Rask never gave his team a fighting chance.</p>

<p>And that goes for the entire series.</p>

<p>When the Bruins went down 4-1 with little more than 14 minutes left, Rask played as if it were still tied.</p>

<p><q>When you&apos;re down 4-1 with eight minutes left and get yourself back in the game to make it 4-2 &mdash; we shouldn&apos;t forget that Tuukka made a big save on that breakaway that would have made it 5-2,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>He kept us in there.</q></p>

<p>Back in the second, Rask had stabbed the puck down low with his glove to rob defenseman Jake Gardiner after a quick wrister.</p>

<p>A reporter in the press box a few seats down pointed and said, <q>That&apos;s the save of the series, if it comes down to that.</q></p>

<p>That was just one of many <q>saves of the series</q> for Rask.</p>

<p>Early in overtime, he blocked Joffrey Lupul&apos;s blast from the high slot, which looked like it would surely whiz through.</p>

<p>But Rask hung tough, and Patrice Bergeron rewarded his efforts with the game-winner at 6:05.</p>

<p>The Finnish goalie didn&apos;t hide his feelings about the importance of stepping up in the biggest of situations.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s do or die,</q> Rask said. <q>You have to make a save. You&apos;re either a hero or you&apos;re an (expletive).</q></p>

<p>Rask sports a 2.49 goals-against average and .923 save percentage to rank 10th and seventh, respectively, in the playoffs.</p>

<p>In the three games Boston lost to Toronto, which included back-to-back 2-1 losses in Games 5 and 6, he allowed eight goals.</p>

<p>In both of those, the Bruins waited until the third period to get on the board. Defenseman Zdeno Chara scored at 8:48 in Game 5, and left winger Milan Lucic connected with 26 seconds left in Game 6.</p>

<p>That has to be frustrating for a goalie. And it looked to be d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again Monday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Luckily for Rask, it wasn&apos;t.</p>

<p>If the Bruins had lost the Eastern Conference quarterfinal, Rask would have unfairly been labeled <q>the goalie who was in net</q> when the Bruins blew a 3-0 lead in the conference semis to the Philadelphia Flyers in 2010 and a 3-1 first-round lead to Toronto this year.</p>

<p>Instead, he and the Bruins will go down in the books as the guys who didn&apos;t choke or quit.</p>

<p>Now Rask just needs to continue making those timely saves vs. the New York Rangers, who happen to boast a more-than-worthy counterpart in Henrik Lundqvist.</p>

<h2 id="ecs19" class="">What to watch for in Boston Bruins-New York Rangers playoff series</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/what_to_watch_for_in_boston_bruins-new_york_rangers_conference_semifinals.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-15T14:56-05:00" pubdate>May 15, 2013, 2:56 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The last time the Bruins and Rangers met in the playoffs was in the 1973 quarterfinals. New York won the series 4 games to 1. Boston has a 6-3 lifetime series mark against New York in the postseason, beating them four times en route to capturing the Stanley Cup (1929, 1939, 1970, 1972).</p>

<p>The Rangers won the season series 2-1, which included in overtime and a shootout.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a breakdown of both teams:</p>

<strong>FORWARDS</strong>

<p><b>New York:</b> Center Derick Brassard leads the Rangers with nine points and carries a five-game point streak from their first round vs. Washington. Five Rangers are tied with two-goals apiece, but no one has more than that. Winger Mats Zuccarello is next on the club with five points, which includes a goal and assist in the final two games.</p>

<p>Sniper Rick Nash, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade from the Columbus Blue Jackets during the offseason, was quiet vs. the Capitals with only two assists and a plus-2 rating. If he gets hot at the right time, Boston could be in a big trouble.</p>

<p>Center Brad Richards hasn&apos;t made an impact either with only an assist.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> The top line of Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton carried Boston in their first round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Krejci leads all playoff scorers with 13 points. Horton tops the league with a plus-11 rating. The Bruins second line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Tyler Seguin rose from the dead in a historic Game 7 comeback and could become a key factor in this series.</p>

<strong>DEFENSEMEN</strong>

<p><b>New York</b> The top unit of Ryan McDonagh and Dan Girardi averaged 25 minutes of ice time vs. the Capitals and anchored the rest of the defensive corps who didn&apos;t allow a goal in the final 120 minutes of their first round series. This was without Marc Staal who hasn&apos;t played since Game 3 due to blurred vision from his right eye from an injury he suffered back in March.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Boston is in tough shape with their defensive corps. Andrew Ference and Wade Redden were both out for Game 7 with undisclosed injuries and workhorse Dennis Seidenberg skated only two shifts for a total of 37 seconds and never returned. Ference was seen walking on crutches where a boot. Torey Krug was called up from Providence on Tuesday. Matt Bartkowski played the last two games and scored the Bruins&apos; and game&apos;s first goal in Game 7.</p>

<strong>SPECIAL TEAMS</strong>

<p><b>New York:</b> The Rangers are ranked 15th in the league with a 7.1 percent success rating (2 for 28) on the power play in their series against Washington. They are two spot higher than the Bruins on the penalty-kill at 81.2% with no shorthanded goals.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Boston unsurprisingly had a dismal power play, only connecting three times in 20 chances (15%). Its penalty-kill unit wasn&apos;t lights out vs. the Leafs as it finished at 76.2%, allowing five power-play goals. Daniel Paille scored the Bruins lone shorthanded strike in Game 3.</p>

<strong>GOALIES</strong>

<p><b>New York:</b> Henrik Lundqvist was named a Vezina Trophy finalist for the fifth time in his career and won the award last season. He sports a 1.65 goals-against average and .947 save percentage in the playoffs, including posting back-to-back shutouts in Games 6 and 7.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Tuukka Rask has been brilliant as well for Boston. His numbers aren&apos;t as low as Lunqvists&apos; but he is one of the reasons the Bruins were able to advance. Rask has a 2.49 GAA with a .923 save percentage and no shutouts.</p>

<strong>PREDICTION:</strong> Bruins in 7.

<h2 id="ecq1" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid named Masterton Memorial Trophy finalist</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_defenseman_adam_mcquaid_named_masterton_memorial_trophy_finalist.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-14T16:24-05:00" pubdate>May 14, 2013, 4:24 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Boston Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid has been named as one of three finalists for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, as selected by the Professional Hockey Writer’s Association (PHWA).</p>

<p>The Masterton Trophy is given to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.</p>

<p>The other finalists are Minnesota Wild goalie Josh Harding and Pittsburgh Penguins center Sidney Crosby.</p>

<p>McQuaid underwent surgery in early October for thoracic outlet syndrome after a blood clot developed under his collarbone.</p>

<p>His right arm <q>blew up</q> following a skating session at Harvard back in mid-September after the NHL&apos;s collective bargaining agreement expired.</p>

<p>McQuaid needed two significant surgeries at Massachusetts General Hospital &mdash; one to remove the blood clot and another to prevent the condition from developing again.</p>

<p>If there wasn&apos;t a lockout, he wouldn&apos;t have been ready for the start of the season. At the time it wasn&apos;t known whether he&apos;d be ready to go once a new CBA deal was reached.</p>

<p>Most athletes would miss an entire season to recover.</p>

<p><q>It was a scary thing he went through,</q> Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said at a press conference Tuesday. <q>I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s told you, but the size of his arm, the swelling, it swelled up five, six times the size of his arm. He was really scared and feared for his life, so it&apos;s a terrific story, a testament to Adam&apos;s character.</q></p>

<p>McQuaid played in 32 of 48 games of the shortened-season and finished with a goal, three assists, and 60 penalty minutes.</p>

<h2 id="ecq2" class="">Patrice Bergeron line returns to clutch heroics as Boston Bruins make history in Game 7 comeback</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/patrice_bergeron_line_returns_to_clutch_heroics_as_boston_bruins_make_history_in_game_7_comeback.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-14T15:45-05:00" pubdate>May 14, 2013, 3:45 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Boston Bruins&apos; second line of Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Tyler Seguin picked the right time to come back to life.</p>

<p>With their team in the midst of completing one of the Stanley Cup playoffs&apos; biggest collapses, the threesome instead helped execute one of Boston sports&apos; most historic comebacks in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals Monday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>It all unfolded in the last 11 minutes, including two scores 34 seconds apart in the final 1:22 of regulation.</p>

<p>But the goal everyone is talking about is Bergeron&apos;s game-winner 6:05 into overtime, as Boston rallied from a 4-1 third-period deficit to stun the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-4, clinch the series 4-3 and advance to the conference semis to host the New York Rangers in Game 1 Thursday.</p>

<p><q>Obviously we didn&apos;t have the best series, but it doesn&apos;t matter anymore,</q> Marchand said. <q>I think we played a lot better (Monday). We created a lot more. We were obviously out for the last goal there. Now we just got to get prepared for the next series.</q></p>

<p>Marchand had the secondary assist on Bergeron&apos;s OT goal. It was his first point since Game 4. He finished with three assists for the series.</p>

<p>The pesky winger did not look like the same player who led the team in scoring during the regular season with 18 goals and 36 points. There was speculation he could be battling an injury.</p>

<p><q>I think my confidence wasn&apos;t there,</q> Marchand said. <q>I wasn&apos;t holding on to the puck, and that&apos;s my game &mdash; holding on to the puck and making plays. I wasn&apos;t really doing that.</q></p>

<p>But the most criticized of the bunch was Seguin, who had done nothing but put up consistent zeros on the scoresheet until assisting on Bergeron&apos;s game-winner.</p>

<p>Seguin, the No. 2 pick in the 2010 NHL draft, had multiple opportunities to finish scoring chances or set up his linemates, but couldn&apos;t find the back of the net.</p>

<p>He was the team&apos;s second-leading goal-scorer with 16.</p>

<p><q>Tyler, who has been criticized a lot this series, if you watched the winning goal, did one heck of a job in front of that net before (Bergeron) puts it in,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said.</p>

<p>It&apos;s that kind of play the team needs from Seguin heading into the next round.</p>

<p>Throughout the series, the debate over who was better &mdash; Seguin or Leafs winger Phil Kessel, who was traded from Boston for that No. 2 pick &mdash; was a broken record.</p>

<p>On paper, Kessel was by far. He posted four goals, two assists and a plus-3 rating in the series. Seguin finished with the one assist. That probably outweighs all of Kessel&apos;s hard work, though.</p>

<p>Bergeron had a better series than his linemates, also scoring in Game 4.</p>

<p><q>I have high expectations of myself. I&apos;m probably my hardest critic,</q> he said. <q>Whatever pressure is outside of me, I don&apos;t really worry about it because I know I bring higher expectations than anyone else. It&apos;s about finding a way and showing some character, and I thought we did that (Monday). Everyone has to step up in the playoffs, and (Monday) was my turn to do it for my team.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecq3" class="">Boston Bruins player reaction after historic Game 7 comeback vs. Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_player_reaction_after_historic_game_7_comeback_vs_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-14T00:06-05:00" pubdate>May 14, 2013, 12:06 AM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Milan Lucic and Patrice Bergeron scored two goals in a 34-second span with goalie Tuukka Rask pulled in the third period to force overtime.</p>

<p>Then Bergeron netted the game-winner as the Boston Bruins completed their epic Game 7 comeback over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series at TD Garden, winning 5-4.</p>

<p>The last time the Bruins overcame a three-goal deficit in the playoffs was on April 11, 1990 when they trailed the Hartford Whalers, 5-2 and won 6-5.</p>

<p>Here are some Bruins player reactions:</p>

<p><b>Center Patrice Bergeron</b>

<p><q>It&apos;s one of the craziest ones I&apos;ve ever been part of. We stayed resilient &mdash; I guess that&apos;s what I can say. We found a way. Not necessarily the way we would&apos;ve liked to play the whole game, but like I said, we showed some character coming back in the game and we found a way in overtime. We had the momentum, I thought, and our legs were back. It felt good.</q></p>

<p><b>Left wing Milan Lucic</b></p>

<p><q>(It&apos;s) pretty crazy. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been part of a game that was anything like that. (The Leafs) come out and score two goals and I think you can tell from halfway through the first until halfway through the third, they really frustrated us and we couldn&apos;t get much going and it just felt like one play on Horty&apos;s goal kind of turned things around and made us believe.</q></p>

<p><b>Defenseman Johnny Boychuk</b></p>

<p><q>That was unbelievable. That&apos;s one thing you&apos;re going to remember probably for the rest of your life, because it was such a comeback that everyone probably thought that we were done. It showed what kind of character there is in this dressing room. Never say die, more or less.</q></p>

<p><b>Left wing Brad Marchand</b></p>

<p><q>It shows the character of our team and it shows what playoffs is like. You can&apos;t quit even if you&apos;re up by a few goals. You got to keep playing until the end of the game and guys did a great job tonight.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecq4" class="">Patrice Bergeron overtime hero as Boston Bruins stun Toronto Maple Leafs 5-4 in Game 7</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/patrice_bergeron_overtime_hero_as_boston_bruins_stun_toronto_maple_leafs_5-4_in_game_7.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-13T22:12-05:00" pubdate>May 13, 2013, 10:12 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; When Nazem Kadri put the Toronto Maple Leafs ahead 4-1 at 5:29 of Monday&apos;s third period, it looked certain the Bruins&apos; season was toast.</p>

<p>But Boston refused to quit in Game 7 of its Eastern Conference quarterfinal series at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Forwards Nathan Horton, Milan Lucic and Patrice Bergeron netted three unanswered goals in the final 11 minutes &mdash; two in the final 90 seconds with goaltender Tuukka Rask pulled &mdash; to force overtime and shake the Garden to its foundation.</p>

<p>Journey&apos;s <q>Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;</q> blared from the sound system during the intermission. Next was <q>Livin&apos; on a Prayer</q> by Bon Jovi.</p>

<p>Memories of 2011 when the Bruins captured the Stanley Cup came flooding back.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>Bergeron slammed home the game-winner at 6:05 of OT as the Bruins completed their epic comeback to shock the Leafs 5-4, take the series 4-3 and move on to face the New York Rangers in the conference semis.</p>

<p><q>Honestly, when I shot it and I got it through the first guy, I knew it was a pretty good shot and I knew,</q> Bergeron said. <q>I couldn&apos;t see it go in, but I knew it was close, and fortunately it went in.</q></p>

<p>Bergeron&apos;s goal with 50.2 seconds left had forced the extra period.</p>

<p><q>Obviously we wanted to win, and that tying goal was definitely huge for the team and also for me, so it was a great feeling,</q> Bergeron said. <q>Emotions were high ... it was fun. It was a fun ending.</q></p>

<p>It seemed two completely different Bruins teams took the ice Monday.</p>

<p>One couldn&apos;t manage the puck well. Turnovers were plentiful. The power play was dismal as 17,565 restless fans booed their team after a second failed attempt in the second period.</p>

<p><q>You can&apos;t let (negative thoughts creep in) because once you do, then it&apos;s game over,</q> defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>You can&apos;t let it get in your head and we didn&apos;t. We just kept battling, kept trying to do the right things.</q></p>

<p>The B&apos;s couldn&apos;t land crisp tape-to-tape passes. Their puck management was poor. It&apos;s been an issue all series.</p>

<p>The other team showed determination. A no-quit attitude. They&apos;ve been here before.</p>

<p><q>I think our experience is what kind of put us over the edge in being able to come back and ultimately win the game,</q> Lucic said. <q>In saying that, you got to give Toronto credit for what they did in this series. I don&apos;t think anyone gave them that big of a chance and the way that they played, especially the last three games, they have a lot to be proud of.</q></p>

<p>Already thin on defensemen, the Bruins lost Dennis Seidenberg midway through the first period. He logged only 37 seconds and never skated another shift.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien said more on Seidenberg&apos;s status will be known Tuesday.</p>

<p>Andrew Ference and Wade Redden were both scratched with undisclosed injuries.</p>

<p>The Leafs scored in every period of regulation and led until Bergeron made overtime a reality.</p>

<p>Defenseman Cody Franson had two goals while wingers Phil Kessel and Kadri had the others.</p>

<p>Kessel had his fourth strike of the playoffs at 2:09 of the third.</p>

<p>Kadri made it 4-1 three minutes later.</p>

<p>Then the comeback was on.</p>

<p>Horton cut the lead in half with 10:42 left. With Rask and his 24 saves send to the sideline, Lucic made things extremely interesting with 1:22 left.</p>

<p>And finally, Bergeron sealed the deal.</p>

<p><q>When you&apos;re looking at the clock winding down, you start thinking to yourself, &apos;Is this the end of this group here?&apos; Because it probably would have been if we didn&apos;t win this game,</q> Lucic said. <q>You got to have bounces, you got to have luck, you got to have everything go your way, and that&apos;s what happened there in the last 10 minutes of the third period.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins got on the board first after strong board work by Lucic and Horton.</p>

<p>The puck landed on defenseman Matt Bartkowski&apos;s stick and he teed up in front and zipped it past Leafs goalie James Reimer (30 saves) at 5:39.</p>

<p>It was the Bruins&apos; first opening-period goal since Game 3.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Rask stoned Leafs left winger Joffrey Lupul to keep it 1-0.</p>

<p>It was one of many big stops Rask made, and they all proved to be huge.</p>

<h2 id="ecq5" class="">Calm Boston Bruins prepare for &lsquo;Do or Die&rsquo; Game 7 vs. Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/calm_boston_bruins_prepare_for_do_or_die_game_7_vs_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-13T18:18-05:00" pubdate>May 13, 2013, 6:18 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins don&apos;t make it easy on themselves.</p>

<p>Twice they had a chance to eliminate the pesky Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL&apos;s Eastern Conference quarterfinals, but they came up empty with back-to-back 2-1 losses in Games 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Now both teams are facing a <q>do or die</q> Game 7 Monday night at TD Garden, the winner advancing to the conference semifinals to play the winner of the Capitals-Rangers series. The loser will have an early start to summer vacation.</p>

<p><q>Obviously we didn&apos;t want to be here, but we are, so we turn the page and get ready for (Game 7) and brace it,</q> Bruins forward Shawn Thornton said. <q>Game 7s are fun for everyone, so just have fun with it.</q></p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t the easiest start to Monday for the Bruins. The team was stuck in Toronto after finding out there was a malfunction with its plane.</p>

<p><q>It was fine,</q> defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>We got to go eat and right to the hotel and right to bed, so it wasn&apos;t that bad.</q></p>

<p>The team arrived at Logan International Airport around 10:30 a.m.</p>

<p><q>We got in, had a meal together and just went for a nap,</q> Boychuk said. <q>Now we&apos;re here, so we didn&apos;t have too much time.</q></p>

<p>Bruins forward Shawn Thornton said it was important not to get too hyped up.</p>

<p><q>We have to try not to get too high before the game,</q> Thornton said. <q>Try to keep it fairly even-keel. If you get too ramped up, everyone will start looking like they have my hands bobbling pucks, so you&apos;re right, we have a lot of experience, but they&apos;re going to be pretty fired up over there too.</q></p>

<p>History hasn&apos;t been on the Bruins&apos; side when it comes to Game 7s under coach Claude Julien. But that changed when they won three in 2011, the last against the Vancouver Canucks to bring home the Stanley Cup for the first time in 39 years.</p>

<p>Prior to that, Julien&apos;s Bruins were 0-4. Boston is 12-11 in Game 7s, 11-7 on home ice.</p>

<p>The last was in last year&apos;s first round against Washington, to whom they fell 2-1 in overtime.</p>

<p><q>This is a great opportunity to play Game 7 at home. We worked hard all year to put ourselves in this situation,</q> center Chris Kelly said. <q>We&apos;re looking forward to it. Obviously it&apos;s not the ideal situation, but I don&apos;t think it is for them either. I&apos;m sure they wouldn&apos;t have wanted to play Game 7 at the start of this series, so we are where we are and it&apos;s exciting.</q></p>

<p>Leafs coach Randy Carlyle is 1-1 in Game 7s, the most recent in 2009 with Anaheim when it fell 4-3 to Detroit in the Western Conference semis.</p>

<p><strong>FERENCE OUT AGAIN:</strong> Bruins defenseman Andrew Ference will miss his second straight game with an undisclosed injury.</p>

<p>He&apos;s missed three this series, one a Game 2 suspension for an illegal elbow to the head of Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski in the opener.</p>

<p><q>You always miss a presence of your veteran,</q> Julien said. <q>I think the leadership that he brings is missed, but you know, having said that, your team is deep enough and good enough, that shouldn&apos;t be a reason not to be able to win this game tonight ... that&apos;s just the part of the nature of this game.</q></p>

<p><q>To be honest, we&apos;ve been playing together throughout the years with different pairings, so we do have some chemistry between different pairings, different groups,</q> Boychuk said. <q>It&apos;s not like, you know, it&apos;s out of the norm, it&apos;s going to affect us, and it shouldn&apos;t. We have enough experience in the room that we can play with each other and not have to worry.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecq7" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Andrew Ference out for Game 6 with undisclosed injury</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_defenseman_andrew_ference_out_for_game_6_with_undisclosed_injury.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-12T15:17-05:00" pubdate>May 12, 2013, 3:17 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Defenseman Andrew Ference will be out for Game 6 as the Boston Bruins will try to close out their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>

<p>The Bruins lead the best-of-7 series, three games to two.</p>

<p>Ference has an undisclosed injury and did not travel with the team to Toronto.</p>

<p>He is listed as day-to-day.</p>

<p>Ference logged 23:41 of ice time, with three hits, two blocked shots, and a shot on net.</p>

<p>Defenseman Wade Redden, who sat out Game 5 on Friday, participated in morning skate at the Air Canada Centre and will be a game-time decision according to coach Claude Julien.</p>

<p>He&apos;s also been battling an undisclosed injury. No details have been released to what&apos;s bothering the veteran blueliner.</p>

<p>Matt Bartkowski made his NHL playoff debut and skated in Redden&apos;s spot on the third defensive pairing with Adam McQuaid after being called up from Boston&apos;s AHL-affiliate Providence Thursday.</p>

<p>He finished with only 6:40 of ice time with a shot on goal and two hits.</p>

<p>If Redden can&apos;t go the Bruins only other defensive options are Dougie Hamilton and Aaron Johnson.</p>

<p>Hamilton saw his only playoff action in Game 2 because Ference was suspended for an illegal elbow to head hit on Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski.</p>

<p>Johnson has sat out all series.</p>

<h2 id="ecq8" class="">Boston Bruins can&apos;t close door on Toronto Maple Leafs; drop Game 5 2-1</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_cant_close_door_on_toronto_maple_leafs_drop_game_5_2-1.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-10T21:49-05:00" pubdate>May 10, 2013, 9:49 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins had a chance to close the door on the Toronto Maple Leafs Friday night.</p>

<p>But the Leafs refused to let that happen.</p>

<p>Tyler Bozak and Clarke MacArthur scored in the second and third period, respectively, as Toronto beat Boston 2-1 in Game 5 of the best-of-7 Eastern Conference quarterfinals at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Game 6 will be played at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto Sunday at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p><q>I think everybody saw we came out flat in the first,</q> Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg said. <q>Our breakout was sloppy. Our first passes were not on tape. That didn&apos;t create any offense. We turned the puck over way too much in the beginning, but I would say halfway through the game we picked it up.</q></p>

<p>The Leafs played a like a desperate team from the get go.</p>

<p>They outshot the Bruins 19-8 in the first period, but Boston netminder Tuukka Rask (31 saves) made an array of spectacular saves to keep the game scoreless.</p>

<p>One was a stabbing glove save off MacArthur&apos;s slap shot at the 7:16 mark to bring the sellout crowd of 17,565 to their feet.</p>

<p><q>We were in the game because of him, there&apos;s no doubt there,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>He made all those saves. At the end of it we got to play, like I said, three periods like we did in the third. Spend more time in their end than in ours.</q></p>

<p>Down 2-0, the B&apos;s got a jolt of life at 11:12 of the third period. After an icing call, the Bruins kept the puck in Toronto&apos;s zone for over a minute to tire out the Leafs defensive corps.</p>

<p>That&apos;s when Bruins center David Krejci set up captain Zdeno Chara, who wristed a shot inches from the blue line to cut the lead in half.</p>

<p>Rask was pulled with 1:11 to go, but the Bruins couldn&apos;t find an answer for Leafs goalie James Reimer (43 saves) who&apos;s been shaky all series, but stepped up this game.</p>

<p><q>You always talk about being mentally ready, being mentally sharp, and that wasn&apos;t the case,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>It&apos;s about actually doing it, going out on the ice and executing.</q></p>

<p>Both of Toronto&apos;s goals were on defensive breakdowns.</p>

<p>With Leafs winger James van Riemsdyk in the box for boarding, Bozak stripped the puck away from Andrew Ference and broke down the ice for a shorthanded strike to give Toronto a 1-0 lead at 8:33.</p>

<p>Minutes before, Reimer made the save of the series. He robbed Bruins center Patrice Bergeron who was alone on the left side of the net.</p>

<p>The Bruins had another strong scoring chance 2:19 into the second. Right winger Tyler Seguin dished the puck to Bergeron, but was blocked by Reimer.</p>

<p>The Leafs got the huge insurance goal by MacArthur at 1:58 in the third. After a turnover in the neutral zone on a pass from defenseman Johnny Boychuk to forward Nathan Horton, MacArthur jumped on the puck and broke down ice to score.</p>

<p><q>You got to take the good from it, go over some video (Saturday) probably and put this one behind us,</q> Boychuk said. <q>We have to go into Toronto and focus on this one game.</q></p>

<p>Both teams played extremely physical right out of the gate.</p>

<p>Bruins left wing Milan Lucic flattened Leafs defenseman Carl Gunnarsson at the end boards of Toronto&apos;s zone. Seconds later Krejci nailed Gunnarsson again just before coming off for a line change.</p></p>

<h2 id="ecq9" class="">Boston Bruins defenseman Wade Redden out for Game 5 vs. Toronto Maple Leafs; Matt Bartkowski recalled from Providence</h2>
<p><a href="Boston Bruins defenseman Wade Redden out for Game 5 vs. Toronto Maple Leafs; Matt Bartkowski recalled from Providence"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-10T17:54-05:00" pubdate>May 10, 2013, 5:54 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Bruins veteran defenseman Wade Redden sat out Game 5 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs Friday night.</p>

<p>Bruins coach Claude Julien said it&apos;s a <q>day-to-day situation,</q> but didn&apos;t reveal what is ailing Redden.</p>

<p>Redden has had a good postseason. He has a goal and an assist, both coming in Boston&apos;s 4-1 win in Game 1.</p>

<p>Redden&apos;s undisclosed injury sparked the recall of defenseman Matt Bartkowski Thursday night from Boston&apos;s AHL-affiliate Providence.</p>

<p>Bartkowski, a left-handed shot like Redden, has been playing in the Calder Cup playoffs. He helped the P-Bruins overcome an 0-2 first round series deficit to the Hershey Bears to win the best-of-5 series.</p>

<p>In those five games, Bartkowski had five assists with a plus-4 rating.</p>

<p>The P-Bruins open up their best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal series with the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins at the Dunkin&apos; Donuts Center Friday.</p>

<p><q>It&apos;s good that he was been playing. That&apos;s why we sent him down (to Providence),</q> Julien said. <q>At one point, we knew (who) we were going to start with in the playoffs, so because we had the ability to send him down we wanted him playing for that reason so that if we needed him, he wouldn&apos;t be sitting for a long time. That&apos;s exactly what happened right now, we&apos;ve got a chance to bring him in.</q></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time Bartkowski&apos;s name has been mentioned.</p>

<p>When defenseman Andrew Ference was suspended for Game 2 for his illegal elbow to head hit on Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski, Julien dropped Bartkowski&apos;s name in the mix of potential options.</p>

<p>However at the time, Bartkowski was still in Pennsylvania, making it unlikely he&apos;d make it in time for the start of the game.</p>

<p>Instead, rookie Dougie Hamilton, a right-handed shot, made his playoff debut in Game 2. He finished with 13:32 of ice time and two hits in Boston&apos;s 4-2 loss and has been a healthy scratch since.</p>

<p>Bartkowski was paired with defenseman Adam McQuaid during morning skate. That was the only change. The top duo of Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg and second pairing of Ference and Johnny Boychuk remained intact.</p>

<p>In 11 games during the regular season, Bartkowski has two assists and an even plus/minus rating.</p>

<p><strong>TIME SET:</strong> If the Bruins lose, Game 6 will be played on Sunday at 7:30 at the Air Canada Centre.</p>

<h2 id="ecq10" class="">Boston Bruins center David Krejci earning the respect he deserves with playoff outburst</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_center_david_krejci_earning_the_respect_he_deserves_with_playoff_outburst.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-09T16:42-05:00" pubdate>May 9, 2013, 4:42 PM EST</a></time><p>
<p>Boston Bruins center David Krejci isn&apos;t a player you often hear about when national media outlets discuss elite NHL scorers.</p>

<p>That is until right now.</p>

<p>Krejci is at center stage of the 2013 NHL playoffs after taking it to another level Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Krejci netted his second-career postseason hat trick, which came on the game-winner in overtime of Game 4, to give the Bruins a 3-1 lead over the Toronto Maple Leafs in their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series.</p>

<p>His other one was overshadowed in a 5-4 loss in Game 6 of the Bruins&apos; Eastern Conference final series with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2011.</p>

<p>Krejci&apos;s three-point night kept or put him in the lead in three playoff categories. He tops the league in points (10), goals (5), and plus/minus (+7).</p>

<p>Who would have thought it&apos;d be David Krejci tearing it up and attracting all of this attention?</p>

<p>Normally we&apos;re used to hearing about Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh), Alex Ovechkin (Washington), Rick Nash (New York Rangers), and Jonathan Toews (Chicago) to name a few.</p>

<p>But the thing is, Krejci has always put up consistent numbers.</p>

<p>In his last two seasons, Krejci finished with 62 points apiece. This season, he had 33 points in 47 games to put him on the pace for the same total.</p>

<p>He doesn&apos;t score 50 goals per season like Tampa Bay Lightning center Steven Stamkos, but he&apos;s always made a direct impact and shows up when it counts.</p>

<p>Krejci is Boston&apos;s most dangerous postseason player. He now has 57 points in 63 career playoff games.</p>

<p>People tend to forget he also led the league with 23 points in the 2011 playoffs when Boston won the Stanley Cup.</p>

<p>He didn&apos;t make much of an impact in last year&apos;s playoffs, but that might because a pane of glass fell on top of him after Game 1 when fans were celebrating Chris Kelly&apos;s overtime winner against the Washington Capitals.</p>

<p>And what&apos;s respectable about Krejci is his low-key personality.</p>

<p>He&apos;s one of the softest spoken guys in the Bruins&apos; locker room and like center Patrice Bergeron, always credits his teammates.</p>

<p>During his postgame interview, Krejci took the spotlight off himself and instead focused on how if it wasn&apos;t for linemate Nathan Horton passing the puck off before being drilled by Leafs defenseman Dion Phaneuf, the goal wouldn&apos;t have happened.</p>

<p>That created a 2-on-1 break with left winger Milan Lucic.</p>

<p>As dominant as Krejci has performed in the postseason, every season his name still pops up in obnoxious trade rumors.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Include Krejci in a package for Keith Yandle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Could Krejci be part of a Rick Nash deal?&rsquo; &lsquo;Krejci for Bobby Ryan?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The question is why? Why even bother bringing his name into the conversation. Hasn&apos;t he proven enough to earn his keep?</p>

<p>He&apos;s really just making these past trade rumors humorous.</p>

<p>For the record, Anaheim&apos;s Bobby Ryan is currently ranked 59th with three points so far in the playoffs. Rick Nash has one assist and is a minus-1.</p>

<h2 id="ecq11" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; penalty-kill unit needs to step up for Game 4 vs. Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_penalty-kill_unit_needs_to_step_up_for_game_4_vs_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-08T14:06-05:00" pubdate>May 8, 2013, 2:06 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>For most of the regular season, the Boston Bruins&apos; penalty-kill unit was feared by opponents.</p>

<p>Entering Wednesday&apos;s Game 4 at the Air Canada Centre, this had not been the case in their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>

<p>Of Toronto&apos;s seven goals scored, four have come on the power play. Two came in Game 3, which Boston won 5-2 to take a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series.</p>

<p>The only highlight of the Bruins&apos; penalty killers is left winger Daniel Paille&apos;s shorthanded strike in the second period, which gave Boston a 4-1 lead.</p>

<p>Boston is ranked second to last of the 16 playoff teams with a 66.7 percent success rate on the PK entering Wednesday. Only the New York Islanders were worse (60.0 percent).</p>

<p>The Leafs were fifth at 88.9 percent with their only blemish being Bruins right winger Nathan Horton&apos;s tip-in in Game 1.</p>

<p>The Bruins&apos; stellar penalty-kill unit was a different story during the regular season.</p>

<p>It finished fourth in the league at 87.1 percent and netted five shorthanded goals. They had three separate stretches where they killed off 20 or more consecutive penalties. The season high was 27.</p>

<p>However the dominance started to wear off in the second half of the season.</p>

<p>Over their last 24 games, the Bruins had a 79.1 percent kill rate.</p>

<p>Prior to that, they were at 92.6 percent.</p>

<p>The slippage started when pivotal penalty-killer Chris Kelly missed four weeks with a broken tibia.</p>

<p>The Bruins allowed two power-play goals for the first time in a grueling 4-2 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on April 13.</p>

<p><strong>KESSEL VS. MARCHAND:</strong> Boston Bruins left winger Brad Marchand told WEEI.com that Leafs forward Phil Kessel said he&apos;d fight him <q>anytime.</q>

<p>This exchange occurred during the third period of Game 3 where the two found themselves tangled. Marchand threw one of his gloves off, indicating he&apos;d go with Kessel.</p>

<blockquote><q>We kind of came together there and I wasn&apos;t really sure what was going on,</q> Marchand told the website. <q>He was shoving and he told me before he&apos;d go with me anytime, so I wasn&apos;t really sure what was going to happen, but I just wanted to be prepared.</q></blockquote>

<p>Both were accessed matching minors for roughing.</p>

<p>Marchand has four career fights, including one with Washington Capitals&apos; Mike Ribeiro back in March.</p>

<p>Kessel has one scrap in his six-year NHL career, which was more of a wrestling match between him and Columbus Blue Jackets&apos; Kris Russell in 2009-10.</p>

<h2 id="ecq12" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; top line carrying team, while 2nd line remains MIA vs. Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_top_line_carrying_team_while_2nd_line_remains_mia_vs_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-07T15:38-05:00" pubdate>May 7, 2013, 3:38 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Boston Bruins&apos; top line is buzzing and picking the right time to do so.</p>

<p>Through the first three games of their Stanley Cup playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs, it&apos;s been the Milan Lucic, David Krejci and Nathan Horton show.</p>

<p>The threesome has combined for 17 of the team&apos;s 29 points, with Horton leading the pack with three goals.</p>

<p>Each has notched at least one point in every game.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a sight for sore eyes, especially after Boston&apos;s dismal showing in last year&apos;s Eastern Conference quarterfinal against the Washington Capitals.</p>

<p>Horton was out with a concussion. Krejci and Lucic were ghosts, but somehow managed to compile three points apiece in the 7-game series, which the Bruins lost.</p>

<p>Horton scored his second game-winner against the Leafs Monday night at 14:35 of the second period in an impressive give-and-go with Lucic, which gave Boston a 3-1 lead en route to a 5-2 victory in Game 3 at the Air Canada Centre.</p>

<p>Lucic had one of his strongest games of the season, setting a career high in points in a playoff game by assisting on scores by Adam McQuaid, Horton and Krejci (empty-netter).</p>

<p>Krejci is a point machine, and not just in Boston. Through Monday, he was leading the NHL with seven postseason points. The center is also tied for first in plus-minus (+5) with teammates Lucic, Horton and McQuaid.</p>

<p><q>Anybody who watched us win the Cup a couple years ago, he won the scoring title and he&apos;s a good player,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said during Monday&apos;s postgame press conference. <q>And maybe he does fly under the radar for a lot of people, but certainly doesn&apos;t fly under the radar with us. He&apos;s very creative, and not only that, he doesn&apos;t get intimidated by physicality. He&apos;ll make plays, he&apos;ll go into dirty areas, and like I said, a real good playmaker.</q></p>

<p>Lucic is the league leader in postseason assists (six).</p>

<p>That&apos;s not too shabby for someone who struggled throughout the lockout-shortened season and was the subject of heavy criticism.</p>

<p>Lucic&apos;s overall performance has been a breath of fresh air. He&apos;s moving his feet. He&apos;s finishing his checks. One hit that jumped out was a punishing shoulder-to-shoulder blow to Joffrey Lupul midway through the second period, which knocked the Leafs winger off his skates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Bruins&apos; most consistent line during the regular season has yet to make a huge impact.</p>

<p>Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron and Tyler Seguin have been quiet.</p>

<p>Marchand had an assist in Game 2, while Bergeron and Seguin remain pointless.</p>

<p>They&apos;ve had opportunities to put the puck in the net, but haven&apos;t been able to finish. Leafs netminder James Reimer has had a clear view of every shot they&apos;ve taken. He robbed Seguin in the first period of Game 3 after giving up a rebound on Marchand&apos;s bullet.</p>

<p><strong>JAGR, PEVERLEY CONTRIBUTE:</strong> After being held off the scoresheet the first two games, veteran forward Jaromir Jagr created his own opportunity and it paid off.</p>

<p>At 5:57 of Monday&apos;s second period, Jagr stole the puck from Leafs defenseman Ryan O&apos;Byrne behind Toronto&apos;s net and set up linemate Rich Peverley in front.</p>

<p>It was Peverley&apos;s first goal since April 8 against the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>

<p>Jagr had his strongest game of the postseason. He finished plus-1 and threw six shots on net after firing only four through the first two games (minus-2).</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s a real proud competitor and he takes everything to heart,</q> Julien said. <q>That fact that he hadn&apos;t been doing as much as he would have liked to because of circumstances, he was determined to be a difference-maker and help our team.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecq13" class="">Boston Bruins forward Jaromir Jagr quiet so far in playoff series with Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_forward_jaromir_jagr_quiet_so_far_in_playoff_series_with_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-06T17:34-05:00" pubdate>May 6, 2013, 5:34 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>It&apos;s been a quiet start to the Stanley Cup playoffs for Boston Bruins winger Jaromir Jagr.</p>

<p>Heading into Game 3 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs Monday at the Air Canada Centre, Jagr has yet to record a point.</p>

<p>However, his lack of production doesn&apos;t mean he isn&apos;t trying.</p>

<p>Jagr had many strong shifts in Game 2 Saturday. On multiple occasions, he kept the puck in the zone to help create scoring chances, but his passes just didn&apos;t turn into assists.</p>

<p><q>We&apos;re seeing teams have a tough time getting pucks off him,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said. <q>That&apos;s what he does, that&apos;s what he does well.</q></p>

<p>What might benefit the veteran forward is perhaps shooting the puck more often, then looking for his own rebounds.</p>

<p>Jagr only has four shots through two games and is a minus-2.</p>

<p>He&apos;s also been under the weather.</p>

<p>Jagr missed the last three games of the regular season with flu-like symptoms.</p>

<p><q>I know that he&apos;s not feeling 100 percent yet, but we&apos;re certainly counting on him,</q> Julien said. <q>He&apos;s been great for us on the power play, but we only had (nine) seconds (in Game 2), so he&apos;s not able to show too, too much with (nine) seconds of power-play time.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins are 1 for 6 on extra-man opportunities in the series. Right winger Nathan Horton tipped in defenseman Wade Redden&apos;s shot for their only strike in Game 1, which gave Boston a 2-1 lead.</p>

<p>Having a strong power-play presence was a big reason Jagr was acquired at the NHL trade deadline. Six of his 16 goals this season came on the man advantage.</p>

<p>Another factor that might be hurting Jagr&apos;s play is a lack of time to adjust to a set group of linemates.</p>

<p>When he arrived in Boston, he bounced everywhere in the lineup &mdash; including spending time on the energy line.</p>

<p>In Game 1, Jagr skated with winger Kaspars Daugavins and center Chris Kelly. In Game 2, winger Rich Peverley returned to the lineup after being a healthy scratch and replaced Daugavins.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_defensemen_look_to_return_to_dominant_form_for_game_3_against_toronto_maple_leafs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-06T15:48-05:00" pubdate>May 6, 2013, 3:48 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The Boston Bruins know they have to be better defensively if they want to move past the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>

<p>With their best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Bruins are looking to return to their dominant form heading into Game 3 Monday night at the Air Canada Centre.</p>

<p>The Bruins failed to step up Saturday in wake of defenseman Andrew Ference&apos;s absence, who was suspended after an illegal elbow to Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski&apos;s head in Game 1.</p>

<p>However coach Claude Julien didn&apos;t see it that way.</p>

<p><q>You miss a veteran like that, but I think it&apos;s certainly not the reason we lost (Game 2),</q> Julien said. <q>I think we weren&apos;t as good as a team, it had nothing to do with Ference.</q></p>

<p>Toronto capitalized on an array of Bruins&apos; defensive breakdowns, which led to all of its goals.</p>

<p>In particular, defensemen Dennis Seidenberg and Johnny Boychuk had one of their worst performances.</p>

<p>Seidenberg finished with a team-low, minus-3 rating.</p>

<p>Leafs left winger Joffrey Lupul hung out in front of the net to score on the power play in the second period.</p>

<p>Boychuk wasn&apos;t covering Lupul when he scored his second goal, which gave Toronto the lead.</p>

<p>Leafs winger Phil Kessel blew by Seidenberg 53 seconds into the third to score his first goal this season against his former team.</p>

<p>And Grabovski made mince meat of Seidenberg and Wade Redden.</p>

<p>Grabovski cut in and out then found winger James van Riemsdyk in front of Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask with 3:07 remaining in the game.</p>

<p><q>You can&apos;t give them as much room,</q> Seidenberg said. <q>They were flying starting from their defensive zone and we just didn&apos;t have anybody. When guys are pushing into one side where you have a better angle to defend, they came right up the middle and had great outside speed ... it&apos;s a five-man unit we have to be better at.</q></p>

<p>The damage could have been much worse it not for the strong effort by Rask who bailed his team out on a few occasions.</p>

<p>Rask stopped Kessel on a 3 on 1 rush back in the first period, which saw Bruins forward Rich Peverley playing defense alone. He made a big stop after a Boychuk turnover in his own zone, and fans won&apos;t forget the show he put on in the second period denying the Leafs four straight times before the puck was finally cleared out of the zone.</p>

<p><q>I think it&apos;s pretty obvious the number of outnumbered situations that we gave them,</q> Julien said. <q>We had some real bad pinches, real bad reads and everything else ... our line changes were poor (Saturday), we saw that quite a few times. That&apos;s something that&apos;s got to get better. I thought, overall, our game certainly wasn’t as sharp as it was in Game 1.</q></p>

<p>With Ference back in the lineup, the defensive pairs go back to normal.</p>

The shutdown duo of Zdeno Chara and Seidenberg reunites. Ference and Boychuk are together again and Redden is back with McQuaid.</p></p>

<h2 id="ecq15" class="">Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron fine after injury scare in first period of Game 2</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_center_patrice_bergeron_fine_after_injury_scare_in_first_period_of_game_2.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-04T23:44-05:00" pubdate>May 4, 2013, 11:44 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; There was a bit of scare regarding Boston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs at TD Garden Saturday night.</p>

<p>Bergeron missed the last five minutes of the first period after being tangled with Leafs forward Nikolai Kulemin.</p>

<p>Bergeron fell on top of Kulemin, finished his shift, but never returned in the period.</p>

<p>He skated out after the first intermission, taking a few extra laps, and remained in the game.</p>

<p><q>It was an injury issue, but he&apos;s fine,</q> Bruins coach Claude Julien said in his postgame press conference.</p>

<p>Bergeron skated in 25 shifts and finished with 19:14 of ice time. He won 14 of 24 faceoffs for a 58 percent success rate.</p>

<p>The two-way center is one of the Bruins most valuable players. If the injury happened to be worse, it would be a huge loss for the Black and Gold.</p>

<p>In 63 career playoff games, Bergeron has 11 goals and 31 assists.</p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; It was a emotional moment prior to Game 2 of the Boston Bruins Eastern Conference quarterfinal series against the Toronton Maple Leafs Saturday at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Boston Marathon bombing victim, Jeff Bauman, who lost both of his legs and later help identify suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to the FBI, served as the honorary banner captain.</p>

<p>He received an enormous reception from the sellout crowd of 17,565 as he waved a giant Black and Gold flag reading <q>Boston Strong.</q></p>

<p>Bauman issued the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><q>I want to thank everyone for their amazing support for me and all those injured and their families. I&apos;m making great progress and I thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers. Please continue to respect our space and time. I want to thank the Bruins players and organization for the generosity and support for all those impacted. Like all those in Black and Gold, I can&apos;t wait to see them on another quest for the Cup. Go Bruins!</q></blockquote>

<p>The banner captain has been a tradition at Bruins home playoff games since 2009. This postseason the banner captains will feature a <q>Boston Strong</q> theme.</p>

<p>For Game 1, Sean Tierney (Cambridge Police Bomb Technician) Eric Gahagan (Mass. State Police Bomb Technician) and Ariane Thibodeau (Transit Police Bomb Technician) served as the captains.</p>

<h2 id="ecq17" class="">Joffrey Lupul scores twice as Toronto Maple Leafs take Game 2 of playoff series over Boston Bruins 4-2</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/joffrey_lupul_scores_twice_as_toronto_maple_leafs_take_game_2_of_playoff_series_over_boston_bruins_4.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-04T21:57-05:00" pubdate>May 4, 2013, 9:57 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; It&apos;s been a common theme for the Boston Bruins this season; dominating opponents one game then failing to show up the next.</p>

<p>That was the case Saturday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Joffrey Lupul scored twice and ex-Bruin Phil Kessel finally found the back of the net as the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Bruins 4-2 to tie their best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinal series at one game apiece.</p>

<p>Leafs left wing James van Riemsdyk added an insurance goal with 3:07 left in regulation.</p>

<p>The series switches to Toronto&apos;s Air Canada Centre for Game 3 on Monday.</p>

<p><q>We didn&apos;t answer enough,</q> said Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg. <q>We were the ones in the first game that initiated, and it was them this time. We just didn&apos;t respond the way we were supposed to. We&apos;ve got to forget about this one, look what we did well and what we have to do better, and go from there.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins did not appear to be as physically engaged as in Game 1.</p>

<p>At the end of the first period, right winger Tyler Seguin was leading the team in hits. As the game wore on, the Bruins picked up the pace, but it proved to be too late.</p>

<p><q>We did play physical; we just have to go through guys instead of stick checking sometimes,</q> defenseman Johnny Boychuk said. <q>Overall I thought we played a good game, but it wasn&apos;t good enough.</q></p>

<p>After failing to record a point against his former team in the regular season, Kessel broke through on a breakaway 43 seconds into the third period to give Toronto a 3-1 lead.</p>

<p>He was rewarded with boos from the sellout crowd of 17,565.</p>

<p>Leafs center Nazem Kadri found Kessel alone up front after the Leafs got the puck away from Bruins center David Krejci in their defensive zone.</p>

<p>Boychuk gave the Bruins life with a goal at 10:35 of the third off feeds from defenseman Zdeno Chara and left wing Brad Marchand.</p>

<p>After a shaky first period by the Bruins&apos; top line, Milan Lucic, Krejci, and Nathan Horton, they delivered 1:54 into the second.</p>

<p>Lucic ripped a shot from the left circle that bounced off Leafs netminder James Reimer (39 saves) with Horton and Leafs defenseman Cody Franson driving to the net.</p>

<p>Video replay showed the puck hit Horton&apos;s skate, but it was deemed a good goal because there wasn&apos;t a distinct kicking motion.</p>

<p>The Bruins weren&apos;t able to build off the momentum, however, as Toronto tied it at 5:18 on the power play.</p>

<p>With Chara in the box for a questionable tripping call, Lupul hung out in front and backhanded the puck in.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Lupul struck again.</p>

<p>Guarded by Seidenberg down the right side, winger Matt Frattin fed a cross-ice pass to Lupul, who banged it home at 11:56.</p>

<p>When it appeared that the Leafs would take a two-goal advantage, Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask (28 saves) morphed into a magician and denied them four straight times before the puck was finally cleared out of the zone.</p>

<p><q>They had more shots, they had more speed in the neutral zone,</q> Rask said. <q>They created a lot of tips in front, they battled for those loose pucks in front of the net and they really got rewarded ... (next game) we would like to be a little stronger in front of our own net.</q></p>

<p>Rask came up big with 5:52 remaining in the first period to keep it scoreless, using his left leg to stop Kessel as he drove to the net on a 3 on 1 break.</p>

<p>Bruins forward Rich Peverley found himself playing defense alone as a pack of Leafs blew past Chara.</p>

<p>Center Gregory Campbell almost put the B&apos;s on the board first at 13:24 of the opening period. Campbell intercepted a pass past the blue line in the Leafs zone and rifled a shot at Reimer, who stopped it with his glove and covered up the loose puck.</p>

<h2 id="ecq18" class="">Boston Bruins&apos; energy line shows depth, versatility, heading into Game 2 of playoff series with Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_energy_line_shows_depth_versatility_heading_into_game_2_of_playoff_series_with_toronto.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-04T16:41-05:00" pubdate>May 4, 2013, 4:41 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; The Boston Bruins&apos; fourth line of Daniel Paille, Gregory Campbell, and Shawn Thornton has served as a valuable part of the team&apos;s success over the last three seasons.</p>

<p>Known as the energy or Merlot line, the latter due to their wine red practice jerseys, the threesome helped create a spark in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs Wednesday.</p>

<p>Campbell and Paille assisted on defenseman Wade Redden&apos;s tying goal at 16:20 in the first period and there was no looking back as the Bruins went on to win, 4-1.</p>

<p>Thornton threw his body around, finishing with a team-high five hits, and got in Leafs counterpart Colton Orr&apos;s face minutes after Toronto took a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal by James van Riemsdyk.</p>

<p>Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid landed a big hit on Leafs center Jay McClement and Thornton and Orr automatically engaged before being quickly separated by the linesmen.</p>

<p>It&apos;s those elements that help feed the team, and when all four lines are rolling, the B&apos;s make it extremely difficult for opponents to find an edge.</p>

<p><q>I guess that&apos;s our job a lot of the time &mdash; to create energy, to change momentum and just be hard to play against,</q> Campbell said. <q>It&apos;s important to be hard on the puck and win battles and do little things well in the playoffs.</q></p>

<p>What opponents might not realize is how versatile the Merlot line is.</p>

<p>When Patrice Bergeron missed time with a concussion, Campbell centered Brad Marchand and Jaromir Jagr on the second line. The three combined for six points and a plus-five rating in a 6-2 win over Carolina on April 8.</p>

<p>Paille has skated on every line at some point during the lockout-shortened season. He hit double digits in goals for the first time since 2009-10 with 10 in 46 games and finished with 17 points and a plus-3 rating.</p>

<p><strong>SPOT EARNED:</strong> Redden quickly showed skeptics why he deserved a start in Game 1. The veteran defenseman, who was picked up at the NHL trade deadline from St. Louis for a 2014 draft pick, tallied the Bruins&apos; first goal.</p>

<p>He nearly had another until video replay showed right wing Nathan Horton tipped in his power-play blast to give Boston a 2-1 edge with 11.7 seconds left in the opening period.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien is impressed by Redden&apos;s demeanor, as he serves as a good role model for the younger players.</p>

<p><q>(Wade Redden&apos;s) a pretty calm individual, so experience, again, always helps,</q> Julien said. <q>It certainly helps to have an experienced guy to play with other guys at times, whether it&apos;s on the fourth line or a (defensive) line, but at the same time, everybody has to take care of their own job.</q></p>

<p><strong>PLAYOFF EXPERIENCE:</strong> The Bruins entered the 2013 playoffs with all but four players (defensemen Dougie Hamilton and Aaron Johnson, forward Carl Soderberg and goalie Anton Khudobin) with NHL playoff experience, combining for 1,273 games and 22 championship rings. Defensemen Zdeno Chara, Andrew Ference and Redden, and forwards Jaromir Jagr and Jay Pandolfo have 100-plus games apiece. Only 10 players on Toronto&apos;s roster played in the postseason prior to Game 1, totaling 206 games. Fifteen players had no NHL playoff experience.</p>

<p><strong>SEASON TICKETS SOLD OUT:</strong> Bruins season tickets for the 2013-14 season in the loge and balcony sections are sold out. Fans who are still interested can get priority access to seats when they become available by joining the Bruins&apos; season ticket waiting list.

<h2 id="ecq19" class="">Boston Bruins prepare for life without defenseman Andrew Ference for Game 2 against Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_prepare_for_life_without_defenseman_andrew_ference_for_game_2_against_toronto_maple_le.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-03T15:04-05:00" pubdate>May 3, 2013, 3:04 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>With Boston Bruins defenseman Andrew Ference unavailable for Game 2 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series against the Toronto Maple Leafs Saturday, coach Claude Julien went to work adjusting his defensive pairings.</p>

<p>Ference was suspended for one game Thursday because of an illegal hit to Maple Leafs forward Mikhail Grabovski&apos;s head in Game 1.</p>

<p>At practice at Ristuccia Arena in Wilmington Friday, Julien broke up the top shutdown duo of Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg. Chara was paired with Adam McQuaid. Seidenberg moved to the left side in Ference&apos;s spot with Johnny Boychuk, and Wade Redden skated with rookie Dougie Hamilton.</p>

<p>Julien was confident that McQuaid will be fine skating on the top defensive unit.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s done that job before. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s an issue,</q> Julien said. <q>With (Adam McQuaid) it&apos;s always confidence with the puck, it&apos;s never about defending. (McQuaid&apos;s) been a pretty good defender, physical, he can handle the speed, he can handle the size, so he&apos;s probably been appreciated a lot that way.</q></p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Aq5kTC2XpY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>Hamilton was a healthy scratch along with defenseman Aaron Johnson, and forwards Rich Peverley, Jay Pandolfo and Carl Soderberg Wednesday.</p>

<p>If these pairings hold, it will be Hamilton&apos;s first NHL playoff appearance. However, Julien said that Johnson and Matt Bartkowski, who&apos;s playing with Providence in their Calder Cup playoff series with Hershey, could be possibilities.</p>

<p><q>We&apos;ll see,</q> Julien said when asked if Hamilton will play. <q>We&apos;ve still got a day here, we&apos;ve got lots of (defensemen) that are available. We&apos;ll make that decision (Saturday).</q></p>

<p>Peverley was back at left wing on the third line with center Chris Kelly and wing Jaromir Jagr.</p>

<p>Pandolfo, Soderberg, and Kaspars Daugavins, who played in Game 1, was the extra line.</p>

<p><q>I don&apos;t think we intended on sitting (Peverley) out the whole time,</q> Julien said. <q>I think we started off with a lineup that we thought was deserving of starting last game. We have an opportunity here moving forward to decide what we want to do.</q></p>

<p>Peverley recorded three assists in four games against the Leafs in the regular season. He scored in the Bruins&apos; season finale against the Ottawa Senators and had an assist the game before against the Washington Capitals.</p>

<h2 id="ecq20" class="">Boston Bruins happy to have a healthy Nathan Horton in their playoff run</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_happy_to_have_a_healthy_nathan_horton_in_their_playoff_run.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-02T14:29-05:00" pubdate>May 2, 2013, 2:29 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>Heading into their first round playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Boston Bruins weren&apos;t sure if they&apos;d have a healthy Nathan Horton.</p>

<p>The Bruins right winger missed the last five games with an upper-body injury suffered in a fight with Pittsburgh Penguins winger Jarome Iginla on April 20.</p>

<p>He didn&apos;t participate in practice with the team until Tuesday and coach Claude Julien listed Horton as a game-time decision for Wednesday.</p>

<p>To no one&apos;s surprise, Horton was a go and helped anchor the top line with center David Krejci and winger Milan Lucic as the Bruins took Game 1, 4-1 at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Horton notched the game-winning goal coming on the power play with 11.7 seconds remaining in the first period to give Boston a 2-1 edge.</p>

<p><q>That was such a turn of events,</q> Bruins defenseman Wade Redden said. <q>It was obviously, for us, to get that one was huge going into the second. We didn&apos;t really let off the gas I don&apos;t think a whole lot. We kept going at them and got a few more big ones.</q></p>

<p>Horton has a history with game-winning strikes. He registered three of them during the Bruins&apos; 2010-11 Stanley Cup championship run before going down with a concussion in Game 3 of the finals against Vancouver.</p>

<p>He was an overtime hero twice in Games 5 and 7 of their first round series with the Montreal Canadiens and scored the only goal in Game 7 of the conference finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning.</p>

<p>It was a big blow not having Horton in last year&apos;s short-lived playoff run where Boston was ousted in the first round by the Washington Capitals in seven games.</p>

<p>Horton missed the final 36 games of the regular season with another concussion suffered in January after a hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Tom Sesito.</p>

<p><q>He&apos;s stepped up and scored some big goals and he&apos;s been a big part of this hockey team since he&apos;s been here,</q> Lucic said. <q>I even said it, it was a big loss not having him a part of our group last year heading into the playoffs and it&apos;s good to see him healthy again and helping us win.</q></p>

<p>In 22 career playoff games, Horton has nine goals and nine assists &apos; all with the Bruins.</p>

<p>The entire top line all performed big with Krejci leading the way with a goal and two assists. Lucic had two assists. The three finished with a combined plus-6 rating.</p>

<p>And they weren&apos;t shy from dishing out heavy hits as Lucic had four and Horton with three.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a deadly combination for any opponent to deal with.</p>

<p><q>As a line, I think we did a good job,</q> Krejci said. <q>We put the puck in the net. But in the playoffs, there&apos;s always somebody new to be a hero, so (Wednesday night) I feel like we had a good game, but if we want to make a good run, we know that we&apos;re going to need all four lines.</q></p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; When Boston Bruins center David Krejci is hot, good things happen.</p>

<p>Krejci recorded a goal and two assists in the Bruins&apos; 4-1 win in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series over the Toronto Maple Leafs Wednesday night.</p>

<p><q>We just try to go out there and play our best,</q> Krejci said. <q>I think we had a lot of chances today and when you have lots of chances you have to make sure you bury them. Today we did that in the first two periods, we didn&apos;t get them all in the third, but a win is a win and we&apos;re pretty happy with the outcome.</q></p>

<p>Krejci assisted on Nathan Horton&apos;s tip in with 11.7 seconds left in the first period, which put Boston up, 2-1, scored in the second, and later assisted on defenseman Johnny Boychuk&apos;s blast at 15:44.</p>

<p>It was his 21st career playoff goal and 13th multiple-point game.</p>

<p>His effort made him the Bruins&apos; player of the game a tradition started by teammate Andrew Ference during the 2010-11 playoffs.</p>

<p>Krejci sported a Watertown Police department cap and an army ranger jacket with a Bruins patch on the right arm along with the American flag.</p>

<p><q>Andrew Ference &mdash; he&apos;s a buddy with a few of the rangers and you can see that we support them and they gave us this jacket to show their support,</q> Krejci said.</p>

<p>BOSTON &mdash; The best thing to happen to the Boston Bruins was Toronto Maple Leafs left winger James van Riemsdyk scoring a power-play goal at 1:54 of the opening period.</p>

<p>It woke the Bears up from their two-week hibernation.</p>

<p>Defenseman Wade Redden and right winger Nathan Horton scored in the first period and center David Krejci and defenseman Johnny Boychuk did the damage in the second as the Bruins beat the Maple Leafs 4-1 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals Wednesday night at TD Garden.</p>

<p>Bruins netminder Tuukka Rask wasn&apos;t too busy between the pipes as the Leafs failed to hit double digits in shots in a period.</p>

<p><q>I&apos;m not going to take a break there even if we&apos;re up 10-0 because you never know what&apos;s going to happen,</q> said Rask, who had 19 saves. <q>It&apos;s good that we scored goals. We scored good goals, guys crashed the net and we get tips and stuff like that, so it&apos;s a great sign.</q></p>

<p>Leafs goalie James Reimer, on the other hand, saw plenty of pucks and finished with 36 saves.</p>

<p>It was a great turnaround for Boston, which started off asleep in its own zone.</p>

<p>With Bruins center Patrice Bergeron in the box for tripping, van Riemsdyk scored 15 seconds into the power play as the Bruins failed to clear after a couple of big stops by Rask.</p>

<p>Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara was caught chasing the puck behind the net, which left van Riemsdyk open in front.</p>

<p>But the goal lit a fire, and the Bruins morphed into their big, bad selves.</p>

<p>Minutes after van Riemsdyk&apos;s strike, Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid landed a big hit on center Jay McClement. Bruins enforcer Shawn Thornton and counterpart Colton Orr automatically engaged, but were quickly broken up by the linesmen.</p>

<p>Then the show began as Bruins defenseman Wade Redden made the sellout crowd of 17,565 erupt, tying the game with a bomb from the left point that zipped through Reimer with 3:40 left in the first period.</p>

<p><q>That first goal by (Redden) was huge, got the bench really going and the building,</q> said Bruins defenseman Andrew Ference. <q>Johnny’s was an absolute rocket; so nice for him to step up like that.</q></p>

<p>That&apos;s when it heated up for Boston, on the power play, of all things.</p>

<p>In transition, Krejci found Redden, who launched another bomb from the right side. Horton was positioned perfectly in front of the goal and tipped it in to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead with 11.7 seconds left in the period.</p>

<p>Leafs defenseman Dion Phaneuf was in the box for slashing Seguin with 2:05 remaining, and the Bruins almost allowed a shorthanded strike by van Riemsdyk, who rang the post after Bruins defenseman Dennis Seidenberg lost his stick.</p>

<p>Krejci gave the Bruins a two-goal lead halfway through the second period after Rask denied Leafs center Tyler Bozak on a breakaway at 8:40.</p>

<p>After a pass to Horton in the middle, Krejci kept his feet moving, found the puck again, and ripped it in from the slot to put the Bruins up 3-1 at 10:25.</p>

<p>The Bruins didn&apos;t let off the gas.</p>

<p>Seconds after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan were shown cheering on the Jumbotron, Boychuk let it rip to give the B&apos;s a three-goal cushion with 4:16 left in the period off feeds from Krejci and Milan Lucic.</p>

<p>Lucic also assisted on Krejci&apos;s goal.</p>

<h2 id="ecq23" class="">Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Chara needs to continue shut down play against Toronto Maple Leafs&apos; Phil Kessel</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/05/boston_bruins_captain_zdeno_chara_needs_to_continue_shut_down_play_against_toronto_maple_leafs_phil.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-05-01T17:07-05:00" pubdate>May 1, 2013, 5:07 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>BOSTON &mdash; Many factors came into play during the Boston Bruins 2011 Stanley Cup championship.</p>

<p>Tim Thomas was a brick wall. Rookies Brad Marchand and Tyler Seguin answered the bell. Nathan Horton was a playoff hero then served as motivation after he went down with a concussion against the Vancouver Canucks, and the defensive corps led by Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg helped Thomas be lights out.</p>

<p>The Chara-Seidenberg duo became one of the Bruins&apos; best shutdown weapons, logging big minutes, hits and clears out of the zone.</p>

<p>Heading into Game 1 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series with the Toronto Maple Leafs Wednesday night, the Bruins are looking for Chara and Seidenberg to set the tone and help become their old shutdown selves.</p>

<p><q>I can tell you Zdeno Chara is one of the best shutdown (defensemen) in the league, and that&apos;s what we utilize him for,</q> said Bruins coach Claude Julien.</p>

<p>The Bruins captain led his team in ice time during the regular season with an average of 24:56 per game. Seidenberg (23:47) was right behind him.</p>

<p>But most importantly, Chara has been a brutal pest for ex-Bruin Phil Kessel.</p>

<p>Since being traded to Toronto in September 2009, Kessel has three goals, six assists and a minus-22 rating in 22 games against Boston. He has no points against the Bruins this season.</p>

<p>More than three years since the historic deal went down, it&apos;s safe to say Boston is the clear winner, as the draft picks received became forwards Tyler Seguin (2010) and Jared Knight (2010), and defenseman Dougie Hamilton (2011).</p>

<p>The Bruins know how important it is for their blueliners to show up for the playoffs.</p>

<p><q>Obviously you want (Chara) to be firing on all cylinders, so like the rest of (the team), he&apos;s got to get his game back,</q> Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said. <q>With Zee it&apos;s about a strong defensive game, nothing fancy, big shots, a lot of straight lines. He is, obviously, important to the team, and what he does, a lot of guys follow. He&apos;s got a lot of experience, and we expect him to get his game where it has to be.</q></p>

<p><strong>BEARD-A-THON:</strong> The Bruins&apos; annual <q>Beard-A-Thon,</q> is helping raise money for victims of the tragic Boston Marathon bombings.</p>

<h2 id="ecq24" class="">Boston Bruins vs. Toronto Maple Leafs: It&apos;s Tuukka Rask&apos;s time to shine</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/04/boston_bruins_vs_toronto_maple_leafs_its_tuukka_rasks_time_to_shine.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-04-30T15:07-05:00" pubdate>April 30, 2013, 3:07 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>The last time Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask had the opportunity to be the No. 1 guy in the playoffs was 2009-10.</p>

<p>The Bruins ousted the Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals in six games, then carried the momentum through the first three games in the semifinal round against the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>

<p>Bruins fans remember all too well what happened next.</p>

<p>The Flyers won Game 4 on home ice in an overtime thriller and the tides turned. Three games later, Boston found itself packing up its equipment for the summer losing Games 5, 6 and 7: 4-0, 2-1 and 4-3, respectively.</p>

<p>Now three seasons later, a more mature and experienced Rask is ready to be the guy between the pipes.</p>

<p>His final regular-season numbers are encouraging. Rask finished third in the NHL with a .929 save percentage, fifth in goals-against average (2.00) and sported a 19-10-5 mark.</p>

<p>He matched a career high with five shutouts in nine fewer games than in 2009-10. Two of those came in Rask&apos;s last four starts.</p>

<p>He was solid against the Leafs in three appearances with a 2-0 record, .085 GAA and .958 save percentage.</p>

<p>Coach Claude Julien opted to start Rask in the Bruins&apos; last three games, which concluded with two games on consecutive days at Washington and then a makeup home game against Ottawa because of the Boston Marathon bombings. Boston lost both (3-2 in overtime, 4-2), however Rask&apos;s overall play over his last six games has been dominant.</p>

<p>He made the timely saves, something that Julien has harped on all season.</p>

<p>There were cases where Rask wasn&apos;t making those and speculation surfaced how good he really was. Was there secretly a goalie controversy between him and backup Anton Khudobin who, too, has been solid?</p>

<p>Can Rask make those big saves in big games?</p>

<p>It&apos;s up to him to prove to everyone that he is the Boston Bruins&apos; goalie of the future. With Tim Thomas completely out of the picture, it&apos;s Tuukka&apos;s time to step up.</p>

<p>Rask, 26, will be a restricted free agent by season&apos;s end. He signed a one-year, $3.5 million extension over the summer.</p>

<p>The playoffs will likely dictate his fate.</p>

<p><q>Well, that goes without saying,</q> Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said. <q>You&apos;re judged on your performance. That will apply to Tuukka. That will apply to everyone who is up for an extension. Tuukka is no different than the rest of them. He&apos;s a restricted free agent this year, and after the season we&apos;ll look at it and try to get him signed.</q></p>

<p>Eight other Bruins are set to be either restricted or unrestricted free agents at the end of the season. Those include forwards Kaspars Daugavins (RFA), Nathan Horton (UFA), Jaromir Jagr (UFA), and Jay Pandolfo (UFA), defensemen Andrew Ference (UFA), Aaron Johnson (UFA), Wade Redden (UFA), and Khudobin (UFA).</p>

<p><strong>HORTON PRACTICES:</strong> Right winger Nathan Horton participated in practice with the team Tuesday for the first time since injuring his wrist/hand in a fight with Pittsburgh Penguins counterpart Jarome Iginla on April 20.</p>

<p>He skated on the top line with wing Milan Lucic and center David Krejci.</p>

<p>Julien said they&apos;d see how Horton is doing Wednesday and decide whether or not he&apos;ll start in Game 1.</p>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Jaromir Jagr returned to the ice after sitting out the last three games with flu-like symptoms. He skated in the third line with center Chris Kelly and wing Kaspars Daugavins ... Rich Peverley skated on the extra line with Carl Soderberg and Jay Pandolfo indicating he might be a healthy scratch to start the series ... Aaron Johnson and rookie Dougie Hamilton were the fourth defensive pair. Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg, Andrew Ference and Johnny Boychuk, and Wade Redden and Adam McQuaid were the other combinations.</p>

<h2 id="ecq25" class="">Boston Bruins left wing Milan Lucic&apos;s physical presence heating up at right time heading into playoffs with Toronto Maple Leafs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/04/boston_bruins_left_wing_milan_lucic_physical_presence_heating_up_at_right_time_heading_into_playoffs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-04-29T17:59-05:00" pubdate>April 29, 2013, 5:59 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>It&apos;s been a down season for Boston Bruins left winger Milan Lucic.</p>

<p>But over the last few games of the regular season, it appears his confidence is coming back &mdash; and just in the nick of time as the Bruins gear up for their first-round playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs, which opens Wednesday at 7 p.m. at TD Garden.</p>

<p><q>I feel really good about that,</q> Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said of Lucic&apos;s game in a conference call Monday. <q>His last two games have been very, very good ... moving his feet, strong on the puck, good shooting, physical. He&apos;s really picked up his game, and that&apos;s the type of game we need to have success in the playoffs.</q></p>

<p>Lucic finished the regular season with seven goals and 20 assists with a plus-8 rating. In his last two games, he had a goal, two assists, and a bout with Ottawa Senator Chris Neil.</p>

<figure class="vid"><object width="640" height="383" id="embed" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"><param name="movie" value="http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter-v1/embed.swf" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="flashVars" value="catid=53&id=243789&server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl/" /><embed name="embed" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer" src="http://nhl.cdn.neulion.net/u/videocenter-v1/embed.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="383" quality="high" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" flashVars="catid=53&id=243789&server=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&pageurl=http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/&nlwa=http://app2.neulion.com/videocenter/nhl/"></embed></object></figure>

<p>Lucic is supposed to be one of Boston&apos;s top guns with linemates center David Krejci and right winger Nathan Horton, but has been anything but in the lockout-shortened season.</p>

<p>His level of conditioning was questioned once the lockout ended. He appeared to be fatigued in captain&apos;s practices after opting not to play overseas like 12 of his teammates did.</p>

<p>Lucic erased that talk with an explosive start where he compiled eight points over the first 11 games and had three stretches of contributing a point in three consecutive games from January through the beginning of March. But that fizzled out and his level of play plummeted.</p>

<p>Everyone knows Lucic plays best when he&apos;s physically engaged. In order for the Bruins to move past the first round, he needs to continue on the path he&apos;s on by landing monster checks, winning puck battles, strong fore checking, and getting in the Leafs&apos; faces. A fight wouldn&apos;t hurt either.</p>

<p>Lucic isn&apos;t the only player guilty of not performing to the best of his ability, Chiarelli noted. A huge issue is putting the puck in the net.</p>

<p><q>You&apos;re not going to win a heck of a lot of game by scoring two goals a game. The finishing off &mdash; you&apos;ve heard me say this before, a number of times &mdash; you&apos;ve got to get to those areas, those traffic areas,</q> Chiarelli said. <q>You&apos;ve got to get those dirty goals, and you&apos;ve got to hit the net. We haven&apos;t been doing that with the frequency that I&apos;d like, so that&apos;s the kind of stuff that I&apos;m talking about, that&apos;s the kind of stuff that you have to do.</q></p>

<p>The Bruins won the season series, three games to one. Three of the games were decided by a single goal, including a shootout won by Boston. In the only game that was won by a two-goal margin, Bruins right winger Tyler Seguin had an empty-netter to secure the victory.</p>

<p>The Maple Leafs shouldn&apos;t be taken lightly and the Bruins certainly aren&apos;t, even though they are favored.</p>

<p><q>They&apos;re a different team this year,</q> Chiarelli said. <q>They&apos;ve added to their size. They&apos;ve added a couple of bangers in the back end. (Nazem) Kadri has really come into his own, Phil (Kessel) has had a good year, (Joffrey) Lupul has had a good year when he&apos;s healthy, so these guys, they&apos;re a different team. I think it&apos;s going to be a real emotional and physical series, and we&apos;ve got to play them heavy like we can.</q></p>

<h2 id="ecq26" class="">Boston Bruins-Toronto Maple Leafs first round series breakdown; watch out for Nazem Kadri</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/04/boston_bruins-toronto_maple_leafs_first_round_series_breakdown_watch_out_for_nazem_kadri.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-04-29T16:41-05:00">April 29, 2013, 4:41 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>It&apos;s a classic Original Six matchup and diehard hockey fans wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.</p>

<p>The last time the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs squared off in the playoffs was 1974. The Bruins swept the Leafs and advanced all the way to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they fell to the Philadelphia Flyers in six games.</p>

<p>Boston had a good handle on Toronto during the regular season, winning the series, 3-1, and until March 23, had a nine-game point streak dating back to March 31, 2011.</p>

<p>It was the second-longest point streak over Toronto in team history with the last a 12-game stretch where the Bruins went 8-0-4-0 from Dec. 5 1978 to March 11, 1981.</p>

<p>Here are this season&apos;s game results:</p>

<b>Feb. 2:</b> Bruins, 1-0<br>
<b>March 7:</b> Bruins, 4-2<br>
<b>March 23:</b> Maple Leafs, 3-2<br>
<b>March 25:</b> Bruins, 3-2 SO<br>

<p>Here&apos;s a breakdown of both teams:</p>

<strong>FORWARDS</strong>

<p><b>Toronto:</b> Of the Maple Leafs&apos; top five goal-scorers, only Nazem Kadri (two goals) and Joffrey Lupul (one goal) have delivered against the Bruins this season. Ex-Bruin Phil Kessel leads the club with 52 points, but not one has come against his former team. If Kessel decides to show up, Boston could be in trouble. Kadri is second with 44 points and could prove to be the biggest offensive threat. James van Riemsdyk (32 points) also hasn&apos;t contributed against Boston. Clarke MacArthur has done well against the Bruins with two assists and is a player to watch.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Patrice Bergeron and Tyler Seguin have two goals each against Toronto this season and linemate Brad Marchand has done exceptionally well with four assists. The threesome have been the team&apos;s most consistent line as they&apos;ve combined for 100 points and are the top three on the team in plus/minus. Nathan Horton (upper-body injury) may not be available at the start of the series, which could be a huge blow; however, the additions of Carl Soderberg, Jaromir Jagr and Kaspars Daugavins could fill that hole. Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli listed Horton as day-to-day. For Boston to move on, they&apos;ll need production from its top two lines meaning the pressure will be on David Krejci and Milan Lucic.</p>

<strong>DEFENSEMEN</strong>

<p><b>Toronto:</b> Captain Dion Phaneuf and Carl Gunnarsson make up the Maple Leafs&apos; top defensive pair. Gunnarsson has a couple of assists against Boston this season while Phaneuf, who is tied for fifth on the team with 28 points, hasn&apos;t registered any. Phaneuf averages 25 minutes per game and serves best on the power play and penalty kill units. Cody Franson is an assist machine with 25 to lead all defensemen. Mark Fraser, 6-3, 220 pounds, is solid and leads the team with a plus-18 to go along with 85 penalty minutes.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Look for captain Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg to reunite as the top shutdown duo. Though the Bruins defense has been shaky all season long, it looked better over the last three games of the regular season. Seidenberg, who is not known for being an offensive blue liner, compiled 17 points in 46 games. Last season he had 23 points in 80 games. His best year was when the Bruins brought home the Stanley Cup in 2010-11. Veteran Wade Redden was a good pickup at the trade deadline and will likely log minutes. Chiarelli didn&apos;t want to reveal who the starters will be during a conference call so there&apos;s no telling whether rookie Dougie Hamilton will see ice time right away; he was a healthy scratch for the last three games.</p>

<strong>SPECIAL TEAMS</strong>

<p><b>Toronto:</b> The Maple Leafs ranked 14th in the NHL with an 18.7 percent success rate on the power-play and finished above Boston at 87.9 percent on the penalty kill. The Leafs were a perfect 7 for 7 against the Bruins in the season series and 1 for 11 on the man advantage.</p>

<p></b>Bruins:</b> Boston finished 26th in the league at 14.8 percent on the power play, which tied with the Phoenix Coyotes. On the flip side, they were fourth in killing off penalties at 87.1 percent. The B&apos;s were 0 for 7 on the man advantage against the Leafs, but 10 for 11 on the penalty kill.</p>

<strong>GOALIES</strong>

<p><b>Toronto:</b> James Reimer started three games against Boston and went 1-1-1 with a 1.63 goals-against average and .948 save percentage. He allowed five of Boston&apos;s eight goals. Overall, Reimer finished at 19-8-5 with a 2.46 GAA and .924 save percentage.</p>

<p><b>Bruins:</b> Tuukka Rask was solid against the Leafs in three appearances with a 2-0 record, .085 GAA, and .958 save percentage. He finished third in the league with a .929 save percentage, fifth in GAA (2.00) and sported a 19-10-5 mark.</p>

<strong>PREDICTION:</strong> Bruins in 6.</p>

<p>Though the Bruins shouldn&apos;t take Toronto lightly, this is probably the best matchup where they have a chance to win. Dropping to the fourth seed could be a blessing in disguise, but that all depends on who decides to show up to play.</p>

<h2 id="ecq28" class="">Don&apos;t expect the Boston Bruins to turn on the switch for the playoffs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/bruins/index.ssf/2013/04/dont_expect_the_boston_bruins_to_turn_on_the_switch_for_the_playoffs.html"target="display">By Amanda Bruno | <time datetime="2013-04-24T16:04-05:00" pubdate>April 24, 2013, 4:04 PM EST</a></time></p>
<p>On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, how confident are you in this Boston Bruins team come playoff time?</p>

<p>After last night&apos;s 5-2 embarrassment against a Philadelphia Flyers club who is missing a number of key players and will be hanging up their skates for the season after two games, the confidence meter has dropped to a five.</p>

<p>That might even be a bit generous.</p>

<p>Tuesday night revealed the sad truth of the current state of this Bruins team.</p>

<p>The desperation wasn&apos;t there. The physicality was missing in action. The urgency, nonexistent.</p>

<p>The amount of odd-man rushes, giveaways, and turnovers was ridiculous.</p>

<p>And the mental mistakes? Unbearable.</p>

<p>Captain Zdeno Chara couldn&apos;t handle a simple dump in play. Instead of passing the puck back behind his own goal, he threw it towards a surprised Anton Khudobin who let it slip by. Oliver Lauridsen was credited with the score as the Flyers took a 3-1 lead at 11:31 in the second period.</p>

<figure class="vid"><iframe width="640" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PS6S85g8Xs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

<p>That came only seven seconds after right winger Matt Read showed off superb hand-eye coordination by batting the puck in midair with his stick to give the Flyers a 2-1 edge.</p>

<p>Just like that, Khudobin was pulled and replaced by Tuukka Rask who fared no better. Rask allowed two goals in the third, including one only 13 seconds after Bruins center David Krejci scored to make it, 4-2 at 8:20.</p>

<p>Khudobin was brought back in and no further damage was made.</p>

<p>As dismal as the goaltending was for Boston, coach Claude Julien said Khudobin was not responsible for the loss.</p>

<p><q>Poor puck management,</q> <q>poor decision making,</q> and <q>wake-up call</q> were popular phrases.</p>

<p>The last time the Bruins allowed five goals in regulation was in a 6-5 shootout loss to the Montreal Canadiens on March 27.</p>

<p>It should have been the other way around.</p>

<p>There&apos;s been a lot of talk about if the Bruins can simply flip the switch once the playoffs start.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t buy into it.</p>

<p>Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli confirmed the notion on 98.5 The Sports Hub&apos;s Toucher and Rich show Wednesday saying, <q>it just doesn&apos;t happen.</q></p>

<p>Just look at last season where everyone thought the Bruins would just magically show up against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference quarterfinals.</p>

<p>Instead Capitals netminder Braden Holtby, who we knew little about, helped eliminate Boston in seven games as it couldn&apos;t create dirty, gritty goals on top of scoring once in four games.</p>

<p>Every shot the B&apos;s took was right at Holtby and that kind of play, plus lousy decisions, isn&apos;t going to win a playoff series.</p>

<p>Granted the Bruins were without defenseman Adam McQuaid and wing Nathan Horton (concussions), right winger Tyler Seguin played with a detached tendon in his left knuckle, Chara suffered a broken nose, and center Patrice Bergeron was playing with a torn oblique muscle and broken nose.</p>

<p>So what&apos;s the excuse now?</p>

<p>Maybe the Bruins will prove everyone wrong, but a lot needs to happen from now to Sunday as the regular season closes.</p>
