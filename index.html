<p>Welcome to my portfolio site. Please excuse the appearance as I'm currently learning and building up this page. I listed some of the projects that I am currently working on below. They're nothing fancy right now, but it's something for now. In the meantime, check out my student profile at Startup Institute to find out more about me. Sports, journalism, helping people and mobile are my keywords!</p>
